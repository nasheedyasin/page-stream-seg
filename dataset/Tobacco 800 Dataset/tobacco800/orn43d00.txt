Re: Filtration Efficiency of Vila Rica Filter

Preliminary guidelines for the Monsanto filter development program
specified a filtration efficiency equivalent to the 3.3/52,000 Estron
tow filter presently utilized on the Vila Rica KS brand. To provide
the filter development personnel with this information, RJRTB (Santa
Cruz) was requested to fabricate products as follows and send them to
Tobacco Development for analyses.

1. Vila Rica KS cigarettes with 11 mm. 3.3/52,000 filters.
2. Vila Rica KS cigarette rods (no filter).
3. Regular production 66 mm. filter rods - 3.3/52,000 tow.

The following represents analytical data compiled from smoke analyses
of segments 1 and 2 and also includes the physical evaluation conducted
on the filter rods.

1. Filter Rod Specifications: â€”

a. Length, mn. 66.0
b. Size, mm. 24.33
c. Weight Group Av., gms.
