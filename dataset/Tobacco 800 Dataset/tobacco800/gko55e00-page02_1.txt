Dear Mal:

Merit will be conducting a $2.00 off carton coupon promotion
beginning mid-March via a magazine pop-up card. In addition to
the retail redeemable coupon section of the card, consumers will
be offered an “extra bonus" from Merit (copy attached).

AD of A will be responsible for fulfillment of the "extra bonus"
portion of this promotion. We anticipate that approximately
700,000 "extra bonus" requests will be received at P.O. Box
16095. Upon receipt, A D of A will record all information on the

cards and segregate the ensuing smoker list into the following
two groups:

I PHILIP MORRIS SMOKERS - All smokers who identify their usual
brand of cigarettes as a Philip Morris brand will receive a .
Merit lighter. A listing of all PM brands is attached
(Exhibit 1). AD of A can anticipate to fulfill approximately
400,000 such requests. Once the final size of the lighter
blister card has been determined, you will be notified so that
appropriate size K-Paks can be ordered. In addition, all

legal requirements necessary to send lighters via mail must be
satisfied.

COMPETITIVE SMOKERS - All smokers who identify their usual
brand of cigarettes as a brand other than a Philip Morris
brand will receive three $2.00 off carton coupons. AD ofA
will be provided with coupons and envelopes necessary to ;
fulfill this portion of the "extra bonus" offer. AD of A can
anticipate approximately 300,000 such requests. Given that in
some cases it will be impossible to determine the "usual
brand" of cigarettes for consumers (ie: pack bottom not
included, information panel not filled out properly), AD of A
will process these "unqualified" consumers as competitive
smokers.
