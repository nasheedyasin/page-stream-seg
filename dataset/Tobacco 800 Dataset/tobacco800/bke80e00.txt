RE: Harley-Davidson - POS Material

Dear Mr. Bleustein:

Enclosed for your files are stats of the point-of-sale material we
will produce for a sports bag promotion for Harley-Davidson

cigarettes.

Also included are stats of advertising being used in our test markets.

The attached list matches creative to the market, advertising vehicle
and insertion date for these stats.

Sincerely,

Constance Fassuliotis
