Generally, the point-of-sale pieces we will produce for our test
markets mirror pieces produced in the past. However, you will notice
that there are three versions of each piece. Pieces that simply
indicate "Full Flavor and Lights" are being produced for Portland and
Eugene; pieces that have a "Generic Price" shield are being produced
for Arkansas; and pieces that have a "New Generic Price" shield are
being produced for Indiana.

Actual pieces of all point-of-sale material will be available and
forwarded to you as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

Constance Fassuliotis
