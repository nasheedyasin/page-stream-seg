Re: MALIBU Progress
Dear Doug,

As you know during the month of September we marked MALIBU's first
anniversary as a fully national brand.

To put MALIBUâ€˜s growth into perspective, the attached chart shows that
the franchise has increased +1.6 percentage points as a component of
A.T. Co. sales {vs YAG). And that larger piece of the pie represents
a MALIBU volume increase of almost 22% (vs YAG).

With our continued media budget and upcoming revitalized creative
let's push to continue this kind of performance in 1989.

Sincerely,

o*
