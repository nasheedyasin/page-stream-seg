SUBJECT __ANALYSES ON MUSCONE PREPARATION

The muscone sample from you has been analyzed by capillary GC/mass
spectrometry in both electron impact and chemical ionization modes
Figure I shows the total ion chromatogram. The spectral data gave
the molecular weight information as follows: peak A 238; peak B;
238: and peak C, 236. The natural muscone (3-methylcyclopenta-
decanone-1) has a molecular weight of 238

Both methylcyclopentadecanone and methylcyclopentadecenol have a
molecular weight of 238, while both methylcyclopentadecenone and
methyicyclopentadecadienol have a molecular weight of 236. The
possibility of alcohols was ruled out since neither trifluoroacetylation
nor trimethylsilylation treatment changed the behavior of these three
components as revealed by gas chromatography. This finding is consistent
with the chemistry of ketones which do not have replaceable protons for
the above reactions,

In summary, peaks A and B can be tentatively assigned as isomers of
3-methylcyclopentadecanone (a total of seven isomers possible) while
peak C as methylcyclopentadecenone. If unequive%eal identification is
necessary, authentic standards have to be acquired for comparisons since
standard spectrum is not available.
