Dear Doctor Stein:

First, let me express my app. i on for the invita
to attend the Conference at the University of Kentucky.
is my feeling that the trip was well worthwhile, and I am
quite favorably impressed with the program which is being
undertaken there. Under different circumstances, I would
have serious misyivings about the ultimate value of such
an undertaking, but with the guidance of Bob Griffith and
the Tobacco and Health Research Institute, I feel that some
valuable and practical information will he generated. As
I am sure you are aware, all too often in the past some very
fine investigators have undertaken research in extremely
complicated areas like tobacco without a realization of the

sities of the problem, and have, consequently, expended

much time, effort and money to no meaningful end. The past
several years of experience in tobacco smoke research
at the University, and the advice and help available from ~"
outside sources, should prevent this sort of thing from
happening here.

I am sure that everyone privileged to attend the
Conference is looking forward to hearing of the results
of the programs now underway, or proposed. If I, personally,
or if we as a Company can be of ass mee to the pregran,
we will be pleased to give whatever help is possible.

truly yours,

Research
