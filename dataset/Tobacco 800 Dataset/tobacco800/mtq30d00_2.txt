UST’s market capitalization will be the base for the smokeless tobacco industry’s total
participation to the up-front payment. This will alleviate the burden on the smaller
players and thereby assure their participation and support.

All other payments will be altocated according to market share inclusive of smokeless
and roli-your-own tobacco.

With regard to the smokeless tobacco industry's participation, and in an effort to cater for
this industry’s specific characteristics, it is proposed that a standard can/pack of
smokeless product will be deemed the equivalent of one pack of 20 cigarettes for the
purposes of calculating individual market shares. It is suggested that this industry’s
Participation be equal to 30.1 cents per standard can/pack of smokeless product. An
assessment of 11 cents per pack of dry snuff will be levied on this segment given its
particular characteristics, Attachment 1 details the assumptions used to derive the
Suggested assessments.

With regard to the roll-your-own industry, it is suggested that a weight-based conversion
factor be used to convert tobacco into cigarette equivalents. According to the Economic
Research Service of the USDA, total 1996 roll-your-own volume was 4.9 million pounds,
or the equivalent of 3.1 billion cigarettes. Clearly, BAT needs to confirm these numbers
and the conversion factor of 1.58 Ibs. per thousand cigarettes. It is proposed that the rol-
your-own industry be assessed on the basis of $0.11 per equivalent ofa pack of 20
cigarettes, i.¢., $0.275 per 40 gram pouch.

Based on the above, the per pack charge by individual industry/company on an annual
payment of $15 billion, would be as follows:
