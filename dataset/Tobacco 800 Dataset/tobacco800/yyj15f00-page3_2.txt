The panel is biased toward women (74%), whites (100%), and older smokers
(58%). The biases are very similar to those of the previous study (SIR 90-15
report dated 9/17/90).

Each panelist was given three (3) packs of each product, along with a ques-
tionnaire. Half of the panelists smoked the Control first and half the Test
first. Panelists were instructed to answer questions on the questionnaire at
various stages of smoking. Telephone interviews were used to obtain re-
sponses.

Results of the study are summarized in the attached tables for the following
categories of smokers:

Control: MALIBU Ultra Lights 100's with pre-perforated tipping

Both men and women smokers of Winston Ultra Lights 100's cigarettes indi-
cated the two products had equivalent smoke appeal on al] comparisons.
