EDWIN 8. COHEN
OF COUNSEL

January 13,

Maurice S. Meyer, Esquire
Assistant Director for Compliance
Bureau of Consumer Protection
Federal Trade Commission
Washington, D.C. 20580

Dear Mr. Meyer:

This letter relates to your telephone request that we
meet with you and your Staff, at 2 p.m. on January 15 next,
informally to afford you some indication of the areas of dis-~
cussion of a possible settlement of the suggested issues as
to compliance with the consent cease and desist orders.

That discussion will precede the scheduled meeting with Mr.
Rosch and your Staff on January 20. We are writing you in
advance to indicate the basic approaches which in our view

Will have to be considered. We are not, however, in this
letter endeavoring to include every detail of the presentation
we will make, but we trust that you will have enough to facili-
tate our preliminary discussion on January 15.

In our recent continued discussions with counsel for
the respondents concerning a possible reasonable settlement,
the initial and key emphasis has been on the question of in-
suring an adequate and specific basis for avoiding any argu-
ments about compliance in the future. In our view, no possible
settlement of the present differences of opinion as to what
the Order means, and what constituted compliance with it in
the past, will serve any useful purpose for the Commission
and for the respondents unless what is to be done in the fu-
ture is precisely determined. Only in that fashion can future
arguments be avoided and the resources of the Commission and
the respondents not as heavily taxed as they have been over
the past eight months. ,
