A source of nicotine and ammonia loss to the stack, other than
that shown in the table, is the back flow from the cold regenerator every
time the cycle reverses. Mr. W. R. Kepley has calculated this to be
approximately 0.1% of the flow from four treaters or 0.2% of the flow
from two treaters. This is equivalent to 0.32 lb. nicotine and 0.64 ib.
ammonia per reversal. During the test run reported here, the minimum
cycle time was about 15 minutes. This added about 1.3 lbs. nicotine and
2.6 Lbs. ammonia per hour to the figures shown in the table. Thus, total
stack losses of 3 to 4 lbs. per hour of nicotine and 8 to 9 Lbs. per hour
of ammonia were occurring. This does not appear to be a serious contami-
nation since it is discharged at the top of a 65-foot stack and could only
be detected by stack gas odor for periods of 1 to 2 seconds about four
times per hour. When operating only two treater lines, such more frequent
cycling occurred and stack losses on the order of 5 to 7 lbs. per hour of
nicotine and 10 to 15 lbs. per hour of ammonia could have occurred. Removal
of the four extra {ncinerator burners with their cooling air as already
mentioned would reduce cycling time by improving the balance of the heating
and cooling loade on the regenerators and thus reduce contamination as well
as fuel consurption.
