RE: Grant #3035AR1

Dear Ms. Pollice,

This note is to approve the overexpenditure on my grant
and to ask you kindly to send the check for $8,733.07 to the

Rockefeller University.

I would also appreciate it if you could activate my grant

here at Mount Sinai.

With thanks for your advice,

Yours sincerely

O
Marius Sudol, Ph.D.
