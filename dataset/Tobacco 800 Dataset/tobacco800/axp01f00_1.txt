COMPONENTS IN WiSCO) CIGAR SMOKE AMBRETTOLIDE AND ITS ISOMERS/415

Two major musk components were discovered in Wisconsin cigar leaf smoke
(Peaks A and B in Figure 1). In an effort to identify these musk
components as well as to search for 4 quality supply, commercial musk
preparations from Givauden and Alfred Bader Chemicals were analyzed by
gas chromatogrephy/mass spectrometry. .
The mass spectrum (Figure 2) of musk Peak A in Wisconsin cigar smoke
matched with those of the two Givaudan ambrettolide Peaks C and D in
Figure 4 (mass spectra in Figures 5 end 6). According to Arctander's
Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, No, 105, Givaudan ambrettolide
contains mainly ecyclohexadecen-7-olide (1) as ehown in Figure 7. Judged
from our analysis, the possibility of cis-trans isomers or double-hond
shift isomers being present in Givaudan's sample could not be ruled out
since nearly identical mass spectra were observed although these two
peaks were chromatographically different.

The musk Peak B in Wisconsin cigar smoke (Figure 1), was considered as
another isomer of ambrettolide (1), which gave a very similar mass

spectrum with some minor differences in the relative intensities of some
ions.

ABC's ambrettolide gave yet another possible isomer of ambrettolide
(Figure 8) with a similar structure.

Unequivocal identification of these closely related isouers can be

carried out when pure authentic isomers are acquired for GC/mass spectral
analyses.

In conclusion, despite the fact that both these anbrefolide preparations.
offered pleasing musk aromas, the Givaudan ambrettolide components

seemed to match with the musk components in Wisconsin cigar smoke better
than the ABC's ambrettolide.
