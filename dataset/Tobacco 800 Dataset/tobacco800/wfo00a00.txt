Dear Dr. Ford:

We recently inquired over the telephone about the possibility of submitting a grant
for the November 30, 1993 deadline on the subject of the role of CD40-CD40 ligand in
immune function. ,

We have made tremendous progress in this area by 1) showing that CD40 transmits
signals to B cells that induce isotype switching, 2) demonstrating that patients with X-
linked hyper IgM syndrome (HIGMX-1) have mutations in CD40L, 3) detailing the
genomic structure of mouseand human CD40L. Recently we have embarked on CD40L
and CD40 knockouts using a relatively simple complementation approach by injecting
embryonic stem cells with knocked out genes into blastocysts of RAG2 deficient mice.
These studies will allow us to define the role of CD40 in immune function and have an
animal model of HIGMX-1 to test novel modalities of treatment.

As you may know I have under review a grant resubmission with the Tobacco
Research Foundation dealing with structure function relationship of FcyRI. We were told
that we could submit a new grant for the November 30, 1993 deadline if our pending
grant is turned down. I would very much appreciate receiving a grant application blank in
case I need to submit for the November 30, 1993 deadline.
