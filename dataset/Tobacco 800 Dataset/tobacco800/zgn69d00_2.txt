4 We have made numerous tests by adding
different substances and combinations of
these substances to tobacco to obtain a
milder, cooler, and better tasting cigarette,
So far, we have not found anything that
improved our regular cigarette flavor and.
aroma,

_ The writer, Mr. Andrews, of attached ~
letter may have discovered something that
has merits but I am of the opinion he is
using something like eucalyptol oil or
probably ephedrine which we have tested
and are not interested,

If Mr, Andrews is willing to submit
a sample of his substance, without any
obligation to us, I think it will be worth-
while to make tests, .
