To: The Committee of Counsel
Gentlemen:

You will recall that last May Mr. Gargus of
Hazleton Laboratories requested permission of the partici-
pants in the Hazieton Laboratories' research of Chemosol
to present the results of their study at the 27
Chemists' Research Conference on October 3, 1973.

I am enclosing a further letter from Mr. Gargus
reporting that he has been turned down by the Tobacco
Chemists’ Research Conference, but would like to present
the same paper to the Society of Toxicology next March.

We would very much appreciate hearing from you
as to whether you would have any objection to this change
in form of publication. You will recall that your contract
with Hazleton did specify that there could be publication.

Very truly yours,

oe ¥ Chaslees
