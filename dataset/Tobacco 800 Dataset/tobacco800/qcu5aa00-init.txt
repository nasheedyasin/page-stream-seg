Dear Tom:

I am returning the material from Dr. Flynn. This looks like one
of the many attempts to prove an infectious agent for cancer. There is no
evidence in favor of Dr. Flynn's hypothesis, and much trouble to be expected:
from any encouragement of it, or from becoming entangled with it. My advice
would be to stay clear of it with great enthusiasm in doing So.

Yours as ever,

CL
