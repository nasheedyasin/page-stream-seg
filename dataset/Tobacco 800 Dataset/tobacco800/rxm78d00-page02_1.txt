SUBJECT: Nitrogen containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons

(N-PAH) in tobacco smoke eo

General

Cigarette smoke contains a low quantity of different polycyclic aroma-
tic hydrocarbons (PAH, e.g. benzopyrene) which are alleged to possess
carcinogenic properties. Nitrogen containing N-PAH's are of similar
chemical structure, i.e. have one or several carbon atoms substituted
by nitrogen. This class of compounds is now being studied by various
researchers.

In early 1980 two Japanese researchers (Yoshida and Matsumoto) showed
two & -carbolines (two N-PAH compounds) to be mutagenic in the Ames
test. Similar properties were attributed to f -carbolines by Sugimura
(1980).

VdC Activities

Because of these publications the VdC asked Dr. Neurath in spring 1980
to analyze the harmane and norharmane (twop -carbolines) content in the
main- and sidestream smoke of various tobaccos, and subsequently to ana-
lyze & - and # -carbolines in main- and sidestream smoke of several
tobaccos. In addition Dr. Neurath will be asked to investigate whether
an increased nicotine level will support the B -carboline formation.
(approved 10/2/80).

Coincidentally, the VdC has been approached by Prof. Grimmer for granting
him money to conduct a study on N-PAH formation and analysis in the
smoke of several German cigarettes.

The matter has been discussed by the TFA, resulting in the formation of

a task force which will work out a proposal on how to proceed. (12/17/80).
The task force met 1/8/1981 in Vienna to discuss two projects:
