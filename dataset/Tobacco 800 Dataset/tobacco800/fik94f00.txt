Dear Mr. Beck:

We are now advised that it is still the view
of the companies on whose behalf I wrote you my pro-
posal of August 1, 1967, and to each of which I eclireu-
lated your letter of November 15th with its enclosures,
that it 1s necessary both in the public interest and
that of the cigarette industry to have an independent
evaluation of the Chemosol process in accordance with
the protocol of the Hazleton Laboratories which I for-
warded to you on October 23, 1967.

TI am planning to be in New York City during
the middle of next week, and I can be available to
talk with you at your convenience about further
implementation.

With best regards.

Sincerely yours,

A Ueanwildslbae
