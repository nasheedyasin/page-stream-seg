Dear Ron,

Enclosed are three copies of each of the following documents:

. hand marked-up version of the 4/10/86 draft of the License Agreement

typed draft of the "final" Agreement

There are two minor changes that I made which we did not have a chance to
discuss:

. the last phrase in Paragraph I(e),

. the words "Except as limited in this sentence" in Paragraph 13

I trust that neither of these changes will give you any problem.

If the Agreement is okay with you, we will run off two originals with all
the Exhibits and arrange a day for the signing.

Very truly yours,

CR, Oo
