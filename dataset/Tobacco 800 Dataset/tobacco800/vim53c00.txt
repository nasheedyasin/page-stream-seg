Dear Tom,

Attached is a copy of a memo I wrote following a preliminary meeting with
Brown & Williamson. Please look over the general terms of the proposed
amendment and let me know if an agreement of this sort would be acceptable
to Lorillard. Keep in mind that it still remains to draft this all up in
legalese and that we would be seeking approval in writing from Lorillard
prior to submitting any such agreements to Brown & Williamson.
