Dear Roger:
ar’ and Nicotine Values

Attached for your review and files is a copy of the ‘‘Cigarette Testing
Results; Tar and Nicotine Content’ published in the January 10, 1980
Federal Register (Exhibit 1).

We are required to use the newly published numbers in virtually all

our paid consumer directed advertising in the U.S., its territories.

and that directed primarily to members or units of U.S. Armed Forces
abroad where the advertisement is for a cigarette brand that is identical
to that tested by the FTC.

Where we are obligated to use the new FTC results, they should be
disclosed in the following format:

" mg ‘tar', mg nicotine av. per
cigarette, FTC Report Jan. '80.""

We are not obligated to use the new FTC results where:

{i) the new test results do not include a variety B&W
is now manufacturing or distributing, for example
KOOL Milds 100's, duMAURIER and STATE EXPRESS,

the new test results include a B&W variety which has
had a "genuine product change” since the latest FTC
product pick-up date of April, 1979, for example
KOOL Super Lights Kings, or
