Project 2903

G-7 Concentrated Extract

Site preparation for the G-7 extract concentration at 90-3 Building
has been started. An Anacon on-line index of refraction meter for de-
termination of soluble solids in G-7 extract to permit control of spray
liquor concentration in G-7 plants has been received and is being tested.
A bench model Anacon instrument utilizing the same principle has been
found to give reproducible results after tests during a three week period
developed a satisfactory operating technique.

-G-7 sheet pH was increased from 5.3 to 5.9 in TPD-75 at 90-3 No.
4 Dryer by increasing the pH of the extract from 5.2 to 5.9 with ammonium
hydroxide. Another test TPD-76 is scheduled in order to increase the pH

of the G-7 sheet to above 6.0 for special blend tests.

G-13_ Plant Operation

During period of high capacity operation at Building 601 no mid-
week cleanouts of puffing duct were necessary when large FC-11 leaks
through the air locks increased FC-11 content of duct gas, but when
locks were repaired mid week cleanouts were needed again. The G-13
Plant at Shed 130 was put back in operation on October 15 after completion
of the stainless steel sheél for the separator.

~ G-13_ Plant Carbon Bed Corrosion

The G-13 Plant at Shed 130 is operating with only 2 carbon beds
while the third bed is being recoated with Placite 6000 at Greensboro.
Carbon bed losses are about 20 lbs./hr. compared to 10-15 lbs./hr. when
3 beds are in use. The beds show severe pitting where the original
Heresite coating has flaked off and the steel contacts the carbon pellets.
Specimens of several materials which are under test in the carbon bed at
601’ indicate that none of the 400 series stainless nor copper will resist
corrosion. However, FRP made of Dow Plastic Derakane 470, Hypalon coated
and Coroline 580 coated steel, and Hastelloy C appear to be satisfactory,
the first 3 after 10 weeks exposure.
