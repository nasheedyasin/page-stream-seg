REACTION "A!! FLAVC

Identification of flavor componer ous layer of the Mailiar¢
reaction "A" mixture is reported in this ¢ ica . Subfractions fror
preparative gas chromatcgraphy were analyzed by ica capilla
GC/mass spectrometry erimental detail : Lppen

Figure I shows the preparative gas chromatogram Table 1 lists the oder
transition observed organoleptically at the GC exit port during, the
period each subfraction was being eluted. Table 11 lists in the order
of increasing GC retention time the components identified by capillary
GC/MS. Components teftatively identified are indicated by an asterisi
(*). Relative abundance of the identified components within each sub-
fraction is indicated by peak sizes: +, small; ++, medium; and +++,
large. 7
Amadori compounds from various amino acids and glucose or fructose have
been found by many food flavor investigators to be the flavor precursors
in Maillard reaction. The fact that Amadori compounds are more polar and
have higher molecular weights would probably make them stay longer in the
finished tobacco products than the volatile flavor molecules. ynthetic
methods and isolation procedu: for Amadori compounds have been obtained
through literature searches Studies on che effect of Amadori c

on cigarettes to produce the desirable Maillard reaction aro e

while pursuing.
