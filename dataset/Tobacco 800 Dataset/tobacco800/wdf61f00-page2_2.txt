MATERIALS AND MEâ€™

The tobacco carotenoid extract (FLX) was obtained from Dr. V. Heemann
at BAT-Hamburg. Equipment and columns used in high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) were purchased from Waters Associates (Milford,
Massachusetts 01757). These comprised two solvent delivery pumps
(M6000A), a solvent programmer (M660), an injector (U6K), a colum
compression module (RCM-100), and a UV detector (M440), Separation
was carried out using a silica colum (Radial-Pak, 8mm i.d. x 10 ca,
particle size 51m with a guard colum (Guard-Pak Silica).

HPLC-grade solvents (Fisher Scientific Co.) were used as a mobile
phase.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

HPLC chromatograms of the tobacco carotenoid extract FLX are sbown in
Figure | by BAT-Hamburg prodcedure? and in Figure 2 by B&W improved
procedure. Peak identities in Figure 2 were based on the original
BAT-Hamburg assignment as labeled in Figure 1. Marked improvement on
chromatographic resolution was evident in areas between lutein and
zeaxanthin, among the members in the zeaxanthin cluster, and between
violaxanthin and its cis~isomer. Improvement on the identification
and quantification of these important xanthophylls (oxygenated
carotenoids) can be expected from this improved separation.

Further work on this project will include a precision study and
identification of major unknown xanthophylls in the extract.
