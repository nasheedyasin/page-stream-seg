Dear Alan:

As discussed, the next steps are as follows on the PALL MALL bond mailing lists;

i.) Counts of deduped non-filter and default names by 3/22.

xy Brand Group will supe ly Prizm clusters to target. The PALL MALL default
universe needs to be Prizm-coded and counts provided by cluster.

3.) We can then determine the total names available for mailing based
on the following priority:

PMNF Join the Family responders
- PM Default Join the Pamily responders
- PMNF on database
~ PM Default on database (fill by recency within top Prizm clusters)

We want to take names on the database for 2 years or less only. In addition, we do not
want to suppress names mailed the 1992 Bond mailing.

Please advise whether or not we need to do NCOA processing. We probably do not
need to since the 2/93 update included NCOA processing.

If the list pull/report estimate goes over $ 7,000, please let me know. That is all that
we have available in the budget.

Any questions, please fet me know.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Ars2er oo Woe.
