Then, having accomplished these things, I think that the TI
should contact such organizations as the Tobacco Association of
the U.S. (TAUS) and the Leaf Tobacco Exporters! Association
“(LTEA) with the proposal that they contact the respective govern-
ments of the tobacco exporting countries and ask that these
governments be prepared to arrange for some sort of official
certification that no pesticides unacceptable. for use in the U.S.
have been used in producing the tobacco being exported to the
U.S.

1 fully realize that what I have proposed is a large undertaking
requiring the continuing cooperation and effort of a lot of
people, but I think that if started now, it can be accomplished
in time to be ready for the next crisis or even perhaps in time
to avert another crisis on this particular subject.

Sincerely,
