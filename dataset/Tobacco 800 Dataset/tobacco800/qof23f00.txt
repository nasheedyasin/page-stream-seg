pear pr. Zhvakin:

Thank you very much for the time last week. As we discussed, ne
I've enclosed a copy of the last transmittal letter. 7

Brown & Williamson is very interested in ‘pursuing discussions
as outlined in the enclosed letter of Dr. I. W. Hughes. Slight
adjustments in content may have to be made with respect to the -
delegation make-up on the U.S. Side since the recent elections. ':

I agree with your suggestion that I initially visit Moscow to
discuss the necessary details, In this way, we can take some | :
initial steps expediently. -I look forward to a mutually productive
relationship. - -

Once again, thank you for your help.

Respectfully,
. G. . * stungis é
