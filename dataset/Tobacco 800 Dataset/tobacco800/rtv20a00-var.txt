Dear Bob,

On September 28, 1992 the Industry Technical Committee held
its annual meeting to decide several issues involving the
operation of the Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratery—and to
elect—a—new chairman since my term has expired. Coss sonn
Lauterbach of B&W was chosen for that post and will therefore
replace me as the industry representative to your Scientific
Advisory Board meetings.

I have very much enjoyed my association with that distinguished

body and wish them continued success in their endeavors.

Very truly yours,

het Le am
