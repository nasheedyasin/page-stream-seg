Philip Morris believes that the foregoing estimates are
conservative as they exclude the following:

any increases in state excise taxes which have historically
risen at an annual rate of approximately 5%.

any price increase to reflect the imposition of surcharges
that would result from failing to meet specified youth smoking
incidence reduction targets.

any price increases to reflect the industry’s obligations with
regard to defense costs and those judgment or settlement costs
which remain the obligation of the industry and plaintiffs’
attorney’s fees.

Finally, in the estimate, the wholesaler and retailer
margins expressed as a percentage of retail price are projected
to decline from a prevailing level of 19% to 16% in 2002 and 15%
in 2007.

The Philip Morris estimate may also be compared with the
estimates of Wall Street analysts who are projecting retail price

$0.15/pack in 2002.
