Mr. J. C. Whitaker, Chm,
Formula Committee

You will recall that you, Mr. G. E,. Tucker and I have discussed

“the advisability of increasing the Propylene Glycol in our cigarettes

sent to tropical countries. Mr. Tucker and I feel this would be a wise ~

move, and we also feel you are in entire agreement with this decision.

Due to humid conditions in tropical countries, tobacco products . _

containing no anti-mold agent are very apt to become musty, in a short
period of time in such countries. a

Our experience with Propylene Glycol shows that this material
has exgettent anti-mold properties and, in our, opinion, cigarettes con-
taini % of this material will keep in a sound condition in tropical
countr

‘At present our cigarettes contain #4 Propylene Glycol and 14%
Glycerine, During the war we used as much as 14% Propylene Glycol which

we believe was partly responsible for the reputation Camels acquired for
being sound among the soldiers overseas.

For the export cigarettes shipped to tropical countries, we
recommend ersing the amount of col and Glycerine we are now using
by usin Propylene Glycol an Glycerine in the formula.
