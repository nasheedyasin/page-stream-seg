Re: SALEM King Competitive Product Test

In June of this year, SALEM King was competitively tested against Kool King and
Newport King. Results indicate that SALEM King did meet the established action

Neeee eee eee ence eee nn Ena nnn nnnen ae
standards of:

Action Standard Overall Rating

1. Higher overall rating vs. Kool King among
e SALEM King smokers e SALEM rated higher than Kool
@ Non-Kool competitive 85mm full flavor @ SALEM rated higher than Kool
menthol smokers :

2. Minimum parity rating vs. Newport King among
e SALEM King smokers SALEM rated higher than Newport
@ Non-Kool competitive 85mm full flavor SALEM rated at parity with Newport
menthol smokers

In addition, relative to the previous SALEM King competitive product test in 1977,
SALEM King performs equal to/or better versus major competition among brand franchise
smokers:

Franchise 1977 Overall Rating 1979 Overall Rating

@ Among SALEM SALEM rated higher than Kool Same
King smokers or Newport King.

e Among Kool Kool rated at parity with Newport; Same
King smokers both brands rated higher than SALEM.

e Among Newport Newport rated higher than SALEM SALEM rated at parity with
King smokers or Kool King. Newport; both brands rated
higher than Kool.

In conclusion, the 16 mg SALEM King product met the established action standards and
performs well versus Kool/Newport among brand franchise smokers. Therefore, the brand
recommends not changing the current 16 mg product, but continue to work on the 15 mg
product as part of the corporate tar reduction program. The 15 mg SALEM King prototype
is currently available and will be NFO product tested with results available 4/15/80.
