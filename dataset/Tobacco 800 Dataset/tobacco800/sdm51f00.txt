Dear Dr. Volpon:
Subject: Modified CLD Samples
As agreed, we are sending you modified CLD samples for your evaluation.
The purpose of this exercise was to examine the effect of applying
licorice at different sites pefore or after GLD. The sample
descriptions are as follows:
327616 - Control. Licorice applied to burley prior to CLD.
327618 No licorice on burley prior to CLD and instead all the
licorice applied to the blend of cased leaf dried burley,

paper and band cast recon as top dressing.

327620 No licorice on burley prior to CLD, All the licoricé
spread across total lamina and recon biend.

327617 Same as 327616 except a different flavor.

327619 Same as 327618 except a different flavor which is same as
in 327617.

If possible, we would like to discuss your evaluations in the
forthcoming Flavorist‘s Seminar. Similar samples have ‘been sent to
