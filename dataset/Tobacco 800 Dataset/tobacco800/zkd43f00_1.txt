TITLE

An Amadori Compound as a Flavorant in Tobacco Products

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

_. A preparation of an Amadori compound has been isolated by chromatography
from reaction mixtures with glucose, lysine, and water as major starting
materials. This preparation has been identified as (S)-1-[(5-amino-5-
carboxypentyl)amino]-l-deoxy-D-fructose (Chemical Abstract Service Registry
Number 21291-40-7). It has also been prepared by the reaction of glucose
with N-alpha-carbobenzoxy-lysine followed by hydrogenolysis. Nuclear
magnetic resonance analyses indicated that the carbohydrate moiety of this
Amadori compound existed in an aqueous solution as an equilibrium mixture of
Ppyranose and furanose in both alpha~ and beta-anomeric configurations.

When this compound was added to cigarettes at 100 ppm level, improved
smoking qualities were observed. The use of this compound as a tobacco
flavorant yielded flue-cured type tobacco character, slightly sweet, and
also reduced irritation.
