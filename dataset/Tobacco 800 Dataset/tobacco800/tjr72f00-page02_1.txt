Dear Colin:

The terms on which your and other companies agreed to
participate in the establishment and operation of the
Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratory (T.1I.T.L.) were set
forth in the Institute letter of November 1, 1966, which

was accepted by each participating company. Based on recent
discussions which I have had with each participating company,
it appears desirable, and acceptable to all participating
companies, to modify the terms for financing the operating
of the T.I.T.L.

The November 1, 1966 letter made the following provision for
defraying the expenses of the T.1I.T.L.:

4, Each company participating in the T.I.T.L.
shall make an annual payment of Two Hundred and
Fifty Dollars ($250.00) for purposes of defraying the
expenses of operating the laboratory. The balance. of
the expense of establishing and operating the laboratory
shall be allocated equally among the participating
companies whose respective annual sales of USA tax-
paid cigarettes exceed two billion units.

It is proposed to modify this section to provide as follows:

4. Each company participating in the T.1I.T.L.
shall make an annual payment of Two Hundred and Fifty
Dollars ($250.00) for purposes of defraying the
expenses of operating the laboratory. The balance of
the expenses of operating the laboratory shall be
allocated among the participating companies whose
respective annual sales of USA tax-paid cigarettes exceed
