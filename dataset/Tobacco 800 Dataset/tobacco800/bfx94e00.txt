Dear Newt:

Last week marked the introduction of the new Philip Morris in the
states of California, Oregon and Nevada. We consider it most signifi-
cant that we have chosen newspapers as the basic medium to voromote
this revolutionary packaging of a popular-price cigarette.

Philip Morris Inc. has historically used newspapers to great extent
in its promotional efforts. The heavy roles played by newspapers

in ovr "Changing our Dress" campaign and in the recent Marlboro
schedules are examples of the import we attach to the medium. There
are two primary reasons for this:

1. The concentration of effort afforded by local media.
2. The scope of merchandising services offered by news-

papers.

In the past, we have enjoyed outstanding merchandising support from
the newspapers selected for the current schedule of large-space
insertions. Since this is the first campaign placed for Philip
Morris through N.W. Ayer & Son Inc., we strongly recommend that
you seek the newspapers! cooperation and support in this regard.

All of us at Philip Morris will be eager to review the merchandising
support accorded us by the newspapers and their efforts will be
greatly appreciated.

Cordially,

John T. Landry
