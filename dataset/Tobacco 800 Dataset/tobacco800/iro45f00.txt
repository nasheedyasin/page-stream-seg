Re: 1994 Premium Brands Budget Update.

Attached for your information and review is a
budget update for all your 1994 committed
spending.

Since we are in the process of restoring the lost data
to our Budget System, our on-going budget meeting
is postponed until next month.

In the interim, I am available to address your
questions or concerns on those projects requiring
immediate attention.

Many thanks for your understanding!
