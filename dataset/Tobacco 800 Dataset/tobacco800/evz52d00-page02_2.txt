On the other hand, if after reviewing the reimbursement guidelines you choose to
proceed with the cost statement you previously submitted, we will inform you by letter as to
whether the submission has been accepted or is being disputed. In the event the Original
Participating Manufacturers elect to dispute the submission, the FPA provides that the
submission shall be subject to a full audit by examiners to be appointed by the Original
Participating Manufacturers (in their sole discretion). Pursuant to our agreement fo extend the
accept/dispute deadline under the FPA, an audit would be completed within 90 Business Days
after March 23, 1999. If, after the audit has been completed, you and the Original Participating
Manufacturers are unable to agree as to the amount of your firmâ€™s reimbursable costs and
expenses, the FPA provides for arbitration. The amount of reimbursable costs and expenses
determined pursuant to that arbitration is final, binding, and non-appealable.

The other requests in your letters of February 16, 1999, and February 22, 1999,
including your request for documents and depositions, are not appropriately addressed at this
time. Should arbitration become necessary, you will no doubt request them again.

Very truly yours,

Paul Bardacke, Esq.
