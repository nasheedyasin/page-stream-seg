Dear Lorraine,

We were sorry you did not come to Florida; next time perhaps
you will be able to join us.

| am enclosing my expense account with a word of explanation.
You kindly extended our reservation by two days at the group
rate. When we came to pay the bill they told us they had added
the extra two days to the master account! With a little
persuasion they corrected this and promised to deduct our â€”
account from the CTR total. | am enclosing a copy of our Visa
slip so that you may check they did so.

| understand you were outranked by Harmon, who took the Xmas
card! Joyce insists | send another just for you.

With best wishes and looking forward to seeing you in March,

Sincerely

Drummond H. Bowden
