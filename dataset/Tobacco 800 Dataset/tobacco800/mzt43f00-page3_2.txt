two products, but instead to evaluate alternative methodologies.
For example, is one alternative a more sensitive test of preference
‘‘than another? That is, is one alternative more likely to produce

a significant difference petween A and B than is another? In youx,
analyses, statistical gignificance will be defined at a C.L. of 90%.
However, you are to report exact probabilities. The following
analyses is the minimum required:

1. Individual Experimental cells

a. Preference - tested with a chi squared,

2 (ayy) ?

x! =
(1) = TNYFNFN3

Ny number of respondents preferring A

NQ number of respondents preferring B

Ng number of respondents expressing no preference

preference is to he proken out for:: the total, by sex,
py age .(21-34, 35+), and by tar level of regular brand
(greater than 15 mg., 15 mg. or legs).

attributes - of which there are 10 plus the overall -

are to be broken for: the total, by sex, by age, by

tar level, and by preference (prefer Ay prefer B, no
preference). Also, for each attribute, r's are to

be calculated between preference (1 = prefer’ A, Oo=

no preference, ~l = prefer B) and difference between
attribute ratings (A~-B)}. These r's should reflect the
extent to which attribute ratings reflect the individual's
attempt to attribute characteristics to the products
which justify his preference.

2. Over Experimental cells

a. Preference. These will pe X2's, where the expected
values are equal to observed row frequency X column
frequency/total frequency. Here preference (prefer A,
prefer B, no preference) is to be broken out by
presentation type, by preference placement, by :
replications within each preference placement, and by
preference placement within each presentation type.
