Re: Report Ne. RD.1954 "Investigation Inta The Mechanism By Which
Cigarette Paper Fillers and Additives Reduce Visible Sidestream —-
Part Ii: Decomposition Properties of the Filler"

Dear Mr. McCormac

i read your report with great interest and can’ appreciate the amount
of experimental effort involved. As you may know, we have been
plagued by an off-taste from cigarettes made with Ecusta’s Velvet
Paper which contains hydrated magnesium oxide. Since you have been
successful using fillers other than Mg(Ol) 9 to produce a paper which
reduces SS-TPM equivalent to Velvet, this offers an opportunity to
determine whether the off-taste is specific co the Mg(OH)9 Filler or
whether it is a result of the sidestream reducing mechaniem.

If it is possible, could you provide us with some samples of paper
which reduce S5“TPM ilarly to Velvet (~ 50%), but which do not
contain magnesium compounds. This would allow us to hand roll a Few
samples to compare with Velvet. One or two 45 cm strips of each
sample would be sufficient. Once the cigarettes were tested, we would
be happy to share the resuite.

Thank you.

“Sincerely,
