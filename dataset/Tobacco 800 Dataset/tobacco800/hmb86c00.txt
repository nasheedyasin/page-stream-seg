Dear Chris:

Many thanks for your June 17 letter (attached) which clarifies the age demographics of both
4 Wheel and Off-Road and Sport Truck subscribers.

We are somewhat concerned, however, by your statement that “Bind-in surveys are not a very
reliable means to get statistically reliable data”. While this does not refer to the information
you provided for 4 Wheel and Off Road and Sport Truck, it does call into question the reliability of
“in book survey” information provided for other Petersen books which PM USA has already
approved for advertising based on John Pagliaro’s memo dated May 29 (also attached).

In addition, John’s letter indicated a subscriber mail study, not a phone survey, was being
conducted for Sport Truck and Four Wheel and Off Road.

Pending further clarification from you regarding the above, the suspension of PM USA
advertising in 4 Wheel and Off Road and Sport Truck will remain in effect. Your input clarifying
demographic information/ research methodology for all Petersen books noted in John’s May 29
letter would be appreciated by Wednesday, July 1. This will enable PM USA to make a final
decision concerning the continued viability of its tobacco advertising in Petersen books which
have either been recently approved or suspended.

Please call me at (212) 880-3591 if you have any questions.

Director, Media
