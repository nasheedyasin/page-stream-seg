Re: TAREYTON Production Costs
Dear Doug:

After reviewing your recent response to our questions on the extremely
confused status of the cost of the TAREYION shoot we are still
somewhat puzzled and perplexed.

Specifically:

A) It now appears that despite multiple verbal and at least
one written (see attached) confirmation the talent was
not, and presumably never was going to be, bought out.

If these models were selected by LCF&L in New York, then
naturally LCF&L must have been in contact with the
Atanta agency and photographer. Wouldn't advance
bookings have been made, locking us in at "pre-Elite"
rates?

C) The photography was shot at the end of August, 1988.
Why would LCF&L wait until December 21, to notify us of
a substantial deviation from your approved Authorization?

As you know, the current New England/Pacific Northwest
TAREYTON advertising program is a test of support in strong
Brand territories, The expansion of the program into
additional areas next year has been a clear and often
discussed possibility. Accordingly, we need to see what two
years of talent usage will cost us to fully ascertain the
price of this job executed as originally discussed.
