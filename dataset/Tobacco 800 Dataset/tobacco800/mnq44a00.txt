Forschungsrat-Proposal : "Prospective study on smoking behavior
in regard lo changes in cigarette design”. (see minutes of the
Forschungsrat-meeting 12/16/80, p. 10)

By reading the remarks on this prospective study, one gets the
impression that the decision to starl this study has only temporarily
been postponed but not finally. Thus, the following comments appear
appropriate:

The statement that this study can be a valuable too’ to develop
a "less harmful cigarcttc” could be understood to imply that the
cigarettes produced at prescnt do have harmful effect on smokers.
This is undesirable.

The costs for this study are astronomically high: 25 Mi)dlion
DM/year; especially when one considers that costs for scientific
supervision, scientific consultants, collecting and evaluating
the obtained data are not included.

The proposed cooperation with the Austrian Social Security Adminis-
tration will certainly require same second thoughts because the
attitude of the Austrian government is totally anti-smoking and
any results are likely to be interpreted in that vein.

Further consideration should be piven to the fact thot Gernan
and American life-sty}c, consumption patterns and diet are not
“comparable. Thus, an important impulse by consulting the Kaiser
Foundation Research Institute cannot be expected.

Also questions concerning shifts of probands (e.g. by moving)

and the unrestricted use of personal health data (in order to

be in accordance with the German Jaw for the protection of individual
dnta) should be investigated prior to making any commitment ta
