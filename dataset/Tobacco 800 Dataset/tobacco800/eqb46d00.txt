Dear Dr. Freeman:

This will confirm our telephone conversation of March 8.

We approve your subcontracting $10,000 from the budget of your 1994 award from
the Council to your colleague Rafael Radi at the University of the Republic in
Montevideo, Uruguay. These funds will support both salary and supplies for this work
on behalf of the Council's grant objectives, As discussed, you will be working on
project related goals together when you spend March-April 1994 in Uruguay as a

Fulbright scholar.

Sincerely,

Veal Filecwnlt

Vincent F. Lisanti, DMD
