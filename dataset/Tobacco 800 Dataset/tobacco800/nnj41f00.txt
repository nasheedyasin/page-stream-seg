On July 30, 1992, you provided Brown & Williamson a listing to indicate
which brands of B&W owned trademarks were baing produced by BATCF with
non-caution Labels. I would again appreciate your assistance in
regards to three clarifications.

Is the PALL MALL Filter Duty Free and Eastern Europe product a soft cup
20's or a box 20’s style?

Boes BATCF manufacture NORTH STATE KS SC, LUCKY STR Regular, and
PALL MALL Plain for the Russia Buty Paid market? {f so, do the labels
include a caution notice?

Does BATCF manufacture LUCKY STRIKE Plain KS for Guadaloupe? If so,
does the label include a caution notice?

Your prompt reply to this inquiry will be most appreciated.

With kind regards,
floret 1 frre ten
