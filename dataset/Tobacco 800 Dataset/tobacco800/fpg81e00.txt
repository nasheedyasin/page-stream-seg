Dear Mr. Ray:

When he is not teaching, Seattle University accounting Professor
William L. Weis seems to peddle red herrings.

In his February 7 letter, "Clearing the air on office smoke,"
Weis asserted "An employer that restricts smoking at the work-
place and limits future hiring to nonsmokers should expect to
save: in excess of $5,000 per year per smoker...."

His Vaundry list of alleged "savings" is old news, published in
the May 1981 issue of Personnel Administrator. Then, however,

Weis. was a bit more candid: "Skeptics might .argue that these
figures are as soft as the underside of a porcupine, and that
may be true."

Unquestionably true. Last July 21 at an American Lung Association
seminar in Bellevue, Washington, Weis told the audience he had
done no primary research to support his claims and then bemoaned
the fact that an ALA newsletter had commented that his figures
were "600 times more expensive" than other guestimates.

Sincerely,

ec OS Nesta.

-" “William D. Toohey, JX.

P.S. (Not for publication): I was very disappointed that instead

of publishing my December 2, 1982 letter (reminder copy enclosed),
you. chose to use the current. Weis letter as another strike at this.
dubious' subject. Perhaps the above could help even the score.
