Dear Ms. Clouser:

Per our telephone conversation of today, please find attached a copy of the
meno received fran Connie Branch of our Quality Assurance Department in
Richmond, Virginia.

Apparently, Mr. O'Hirok, our Section Sales Manager for the Los Angeles area,
obtained the cigarette which Miss Thanpson alleged exploded in her face along
with the pack fran which it cane. In this pack, there appeared to be another
"load". There were, however, no sanples obtained fran Miss Thanpson's
associate, Jackie Hamilton.

The assortment of cigarettes referred to in the third paragraph of Miss
Branch's meno consisted of approximately 19 cartons of assorted cigarettes,
both Philip Morris brands and canpetitive products, which were renoved fran
the vending machine on April 4, 1986. As noted in the attached, there were no
further evidence of â€œloads" in these sanples.

I hope the attached will be of sane value to you. Please keep us advised
regarding the actions taken on this case,

Very truly yours,
