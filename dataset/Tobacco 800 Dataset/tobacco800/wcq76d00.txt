The Honorable Orrin G.
United States Senator
Chairman, Committee on the Jud
United States Senate

Washington, D.C. 20610-6275
Dear Senator Hatch:

I am enclosing answers to the questions of Senators
Leahy and Kohl that you forwarded to me on July 28, 1997. The
answers have been prepared as responses by all of the companies
that are parties to the settlement, thus they reflect a joint
industry response rather than the response of only one company
or a personal response by me. Each of the cigarette
manufacturers has determined to respond to Senator Kennedy’s
question individually and individual company responses to those
questions will be delivered today or tomorrow to you and to
Senator Kennedy.

I personally regret the delay that has been entailed
in responding to these questions. I would have hoped that
responses could have been completed earlier than now. The
attention that members of the Committee have paid to this
matter is deeply appreciated. I hope that the tardiness of the
responses has not excessively complicated the work of the
Committee.

Sincer

Meyer f. Koplow
