November 2, 1994

Mr. William A. Adams
The Tobacco Institute
1875 I Street, NW
Washington, DC 20006

Dear Bill:

Thank you for The Tobacco Institute’s contribution
of $30,000.00 to Californians for Statewide Smoking
Restrictions, Yes on Proposition 188, ID# 940908, 591
Redwood Highway, Suite 4000, Mill Valley, CA 94941.

As you discussed with Kirk Pessner, this
contribution "reactivates" the old recipient committee
The Tobacco Institute maintained in California (but
recently terminated). You should file a Statement of
Organization (FPPC Form 410, copy enclosed) and you need
to file a year end campaign statement (FPPC Form 420) no
later than January 31, 1995. As you know, we filed the
Tobacco Institute late contribution as a courtesy to you
and already forwarded you a copy.
