Addressees:

Enclosed is TITL’s “Tar”, Nicotine and Carbon Monoxide final report for Market Sample #40. This
report replaces the draft report of January 7, 1998. TITL, as requested by the companies, performed
retests on 27 brands. These retested brands are identified in the body of the report.

Included are TITL files on a compact disc, readable on an IBM compatible computer. Two unique files
are stored on the in three different formats, One file contains TPM, Water, and Puff Counts in
addition to the “Tar”, Nicotine, and CO data. The other file contains the rounded “Tar” Nicotine, and
CO values. The formats are Lotus “*.wki”, ASCH “*.csv”, and Excel 97 “*.xls”.

For the first time, a portable document file with the entire printed report is included on the CD. For
those who need it, the Adobe Acrobat Reader software is also included.

Sincerely,
