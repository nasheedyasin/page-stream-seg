The validity of Analysis of Variance rests on several key
assumptions including, homogeneity of variance and normality.
We were wondering if your statistical programs test the data
for these assumptions before the ANOVA is carried out? If
not, perhaps a test for homogeneity of variance andi a test
for normality on all data that are to be tested with ANOVA
is in order. Some parameters (e.g. enzyme concentrations),
currently being tested by Kruskal- Wallis, may be more
appropriately tested by ANOVA unless you have historical
data which indicates that these are more appropriately
handled by non-parametric statistics. We can discuss the
statistical treatment of these parameters at a later time.

.We are in the process of reviewing the statistics used in other
studies under your direction. We will be contacting you soon to
discuss our conclusions as well as changes to be made in the
analysis of the "Six-Week" studies.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to call.
