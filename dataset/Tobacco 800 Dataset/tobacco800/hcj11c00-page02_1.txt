Re: ULT/LT Model Development for Selective Binding
Dear Susan:

Attached are my corrections to the Simmons Tar level classifications that you sent to
us. Since MRD recently audited the brand information on the database, we should
use the tar level classifications on the database. Hopefully, this recategorization of
the tar levels will bring the percentage of full flavor smokers up closer to 38%.
According to our latest MSA data, about 38% of the category is full flavor and the
remainder is low tar (49%) and ultra low tar (13%).

There are a few newer brands missing from the 1991 Simmons information. Most of
these are franchise brands (Bull Durham, Misty, Montclair, Riviera). This is not
really an issue since we would not want to target our franchise brands for Carlton
selective binding anyway. The competitive brands that are missing are as follows:
Merit Ultima, Saratoga, Savannah, Savvy and Sterling. Of these, Merit Ultima is the
only brand that is a ULT full revenue target for Carlton.

If possible, the model should prioritize full revenue ULT/LT brands. We have seen

from our NOTS data that 96% of Carlton inswitchers come from full revenue brands.
We may want to weight tar level as well. 47% of the inswitchers come from low tar
brands and 30% from ULT brands.
