Re: Evaluation of Cigarettes for Off Flavor

On November 15, 1967, we received test. cigarettes from three
separate experiments evaluating certain chemicals for nematode con-
trol. These experiments were conducted by Professor Todd at North
Carolina State University, and the cigarettes were submitted by Mr.
Ivan Neas, Agricultural Research Department. It is our understanding,
after talking with Mr. Neas, that the evaluation is to be made in
respect to off flavor and aroma in the tobacco. Therefore, the to-
bacco qualities weren't evaluated. Treated samples 2, 3, 4, and 5
were compared with the untreated check number 1. Samples 8, 9, and
10 were compared with the untreated number 6; and 15, 16, 17, and
18 were compared with the untreated check sample number 14.
