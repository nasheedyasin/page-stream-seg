As you know, the Agreement calls for a process of a full audit, followed by
arbitration, in the event a cost statement is disputed. As it stands now your submission will
likely be subject to a full audit. I therefore suggested, in the interest of minimizing delay and
expense for all parties, that the Original Participating Manufactures would consider a revised
statement that (1) provided an itemized breakdown of the expenses actually incurred in
connection with the New Mexico action; and (2) limited the request for reimbursement to those
expenses, and categories of expenses, that are appropriately payable under the standard set forth
in the Agreement. Submission of a revised cost statement would restart the 30 business-day
consideration period, and — to repeat what I emphasized in our conversation — the
manufacturers would reserve all of their rights under the Agreement with respect to such a
submission, including, without limitation, their right to conduct a full audit and/or to dispute the
reimbursability of particular costs and expenses.

Whether or not to submit a revised cost statement is entirely your choice. You
mentioned on the phone yesterday that you have the information that would be required for an
itemization of costs and expenses. On the other hand, if you choose to proceed with the cost
statement you previously submitted, we will review it consistent with the terms of the
Agreement.

Please let me know how you wish to proceed.
