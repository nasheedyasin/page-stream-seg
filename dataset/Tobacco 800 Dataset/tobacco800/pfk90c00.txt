RE: TRIPLE BRAND OFFENSIVE DIRECT MAIL - Il

TO: THE ENTIRE SALES ORGANIZATION

In January, we conducted a Priority Brand Direct Mail program that was mailed to almost four
million competitive smokers.

This program was such a success that we are running it again. By now, the same four million
competitive smokers have received another CARLTON, MONTCLAIR, or MISTY direct mail
piece with more trial inducing coupons to help convert these smokers to our Brands.

It is extremely important that when these smokers go to retail to redeem these coupons they can
easily find our Brands and the correct selling price. Please, maximize our in-store presence with
extra P.O.S. and displays. Don't forget to Advance Order incremental CARLTON,
MONTCLAIR , and MISTY inventory for this special conversion period.

Enclosed, please find a sample of each Direct Mail piece for your inspection and use in gaining
extra impact at retail.

Good Selling!
