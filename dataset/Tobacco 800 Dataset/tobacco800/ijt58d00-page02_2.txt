This process for preparing stem charcoal is well suited for continuous
operation. Countercurrent extraction would minimize the amount of water or
solvent mixtures employed. The concentrated stem extract could be used as
such or after modification for upgrading tobacco products. A continuous
flow of extracted stems on a conveyor through a furnace would char the stems
producing a considerable amount of combustable vapors which could be fed
into the heating system thereby minimizing the cost of fuel and at the same
time destroying the vapors. The stem charcoal would then be fed directly
into milling equipment and to mechanical sieves and filter-rod-forming

equipment.

This disclosure of a process for making burley stem charcoal is not
limited in purpose to cigarette filter preparation but applies to any
other uses of this charcoal. It also applies to the preparation of char-
coal from other supporting parts of the burley tobacco plant.
