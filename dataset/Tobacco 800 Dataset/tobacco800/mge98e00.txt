SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT ~

DIRECTOR OF MARKETING November 7 a 19 79 ~

Dear Mr. Schiefelbein:

As you can gather from the letterhead, this is a com-
plaint not totally free from bias. It is, however, a
most sincere protest which is reflective of the dis-
may shared by a great many of my fellow commuters.

Since the day Conrail arbitrarily instituted its "one
smoking car per train" policy, we smokers have been
subjected to unwarranted discomfort every evening on -
your trains to Westchester. Every available seating
space is taken and there are inevitably dozens of
standees. Since we are paying the same fares as non-
smokers, I believe this discriminatory lack of service
is completely unwarranted.

My understanding is that the railroad announced it had
decided to reduce smoking accommodations to one car per
train based upon a survey which showed that 80% of its
passengers opted for non-smoking cars. In view of all
the published research which consistently confirms

that approximately 40% of our adult population are
smokers, I strongly doubt the accuracy of the railroad's
survey.

I, for one, and I know I speak for a great number of
my harassed and deprecated fellow passengers who enjoy
smoking, urge that Conrail re-evaluate its arbitrary
seating allocations. Or is there a future plan for
second-class prices for our current second-class
treatment? -

Sincerely yours,
‘ -. fay
