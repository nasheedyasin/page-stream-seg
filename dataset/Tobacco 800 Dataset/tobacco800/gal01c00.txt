Dear Mr. Parsons:

Per your request, a LUCKY STRIKE Filter cork tipping color standard as
provided by our supplier is included with this letter. You will note
the color standard indicates the target color and the associated light

I trust this will be of benefit to you in supplying cork tipping to

With kind regards,
