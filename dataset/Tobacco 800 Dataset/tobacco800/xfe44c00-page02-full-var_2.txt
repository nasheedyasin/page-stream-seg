not yet occurred. See, e.g., Thurman v. Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., 889 F.2d 1441, 1447-48 (5 Cir. 1989).

Moreover, Final Approval will not occur unless and until the
pending motions of the putative intervenors are fully and finally
resolved {including any appeals with respect to those motions),
such that the settlement is finally approved (including as set
forth in Paragraphs 4 and 19 of the Settlement Agreement) and the
Settling Defendants are assured that they have received the full
and complete releases that they bargained for.

Accordingly, no term of the Settlement Agreement, of '
the Escrow Agreement entered into in connection with the
Settlement Agreement, or of any exhibit, rider or schedule to the
Settlement Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, that is contingent
upon the occurrence of Final Approval has yet become effective.

In addition, with respect to the Settling Defendants’
obligation pursuant to Section 2(f) (1) of Exhibit 1 to the
Settlement Agreement to advance $50 million to Private Counsel
toward payment of attorneys’ fees, that cbligation was tolled by
operation of Paragraph 3 of the Joint Motion, Stipulation and
Order signed by the parties and Private Counsel and so ordered by
the Court on February 20, 1998. As of February 20, ten days
remained before the expiration of the 45-day time period in which
the Settling Defendants’ were required ta make the advance
payment of fees. As a result of the tolling agreement, that
vemaining ten-day period was preserved until the expiration of
the tolling period, i.e., March 25, 1998. Hance, the Settling
Defendants are not required to make the advance payment until ten
days after March 25, i.e., April 4, 1998.

Very truly yours,
Méyer G. Koplow
