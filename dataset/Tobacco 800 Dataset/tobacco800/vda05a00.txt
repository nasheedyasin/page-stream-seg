Dear Sir:

Ron Zul phoned our Richmond plant on March 26, 1991, alleging that his
cigarette "sparked" and a stem fell out of the cigarette, burning a
hole in a cotton shirt valued at $55.00. Mr. Zul alleges that this was
the second time such an event took place.

Please contact the claimant and obtain the shirt as well as a sample
from the cigarette pack. Iâ€™ve enclosed a plastic container to be used
if you are able to obtain cigarettes from the claimant. Please mail
them to our Richmond office at the following address: Mr. David Curle,
Philip Morris USA, Operations Center, Quality Assurance Dept., 2001
Bells Road, Gate S, Door 100, Richmond, VA 23234.

Please acknowledge this assignment and keep me informed as your

investigation progresses. Your settlement authority limit for this
claim is $500.00.

Very truly yours,
