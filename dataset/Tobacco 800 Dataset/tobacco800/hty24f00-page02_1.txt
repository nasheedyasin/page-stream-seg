The Honorable William H. Orrick, Jr.
Assistant Attorney General

in Charge of the Antitrust Division
Department of Justice
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Orrick:

We are transmitting to you herewith a copy of the
Cigarette Advertising Code promulgated by the nine principal
cigarette manufacturing companies. The companies subscribing
to the Code are The American Tobacco Company, Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corporation, Larus & Brother Company, Inc.,
Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, P. Lorillard Company, Philip
Morris Incorporated, R, J, Reynolds Tobacco Company, Stephano
Brothers, Inc., and United States Tobacco Company.

We have been requested by these companies to submit the
Code to the Department and to request confirmation from the
Department that the signatory companies will not be prosecuted
or sued under the federal antitrust laws by reason of their
adherence to the Code. The Code is not effective now, and it
will not become effective until such clearance is received
from the Department. This condition was explicitly understood
by all companies throughout the discussions leading to formula-
tion of the Code,

The Code will be implemented through a non-profit
membership corporation being created by the nine companies,
the activities of which corporation will be confined to the
provisions of the Code.
