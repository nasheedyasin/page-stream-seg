As we have an executed fee payment for the State of Nevada, and in view of the
fact that Hagens Berman is the only firm listed for the State of Nevada on Exhibit $8, we will re-
view that submission at this time.

If you have any questions about the foregoing, please feel free to give me a call.

Very truly yours,

WEE
