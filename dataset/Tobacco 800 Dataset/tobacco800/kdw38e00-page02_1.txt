Dear â€œr. Orandey:

In accordance with your request, following are listed our present
commitments. for our current advertisement anda schedule of the
time required for the proposed changes in each mediun,

Our advertising agency is now reworking the suggested ad for
newspapers which we hove to be able to send to the engravers by
this Friday, February 7th.. In this case, the plates would be
shipped to all newspapers during the varly part of next week.
Accordingly, our current ad should not appear in print eubsequent.
to February 13th. Although we are planning to work the engravers
ovar the weekend, it. would be impossible to be certain of any

The one exception to this date in print is the issue of Life:
magazine which will aopear February 19th, dated February 2kth..
At this moment, we are two weeks past closing, and it is not
possible to cancel ar change the insertion, This is, however,
the only national magesine commitment we have at the present tine
which cannot. be changed. :

In television, we will rewrite the live commercials for the Mike
Wallace Stiow to conform with our disoussions of yesterday,
starting with next week's telecast. The filmed commercials for
our spot schedule, however, cannot be reshot until February 18th
and 19th, The threatened strike of the Screen Actor's Guild. on
March lst. has compelled all advertisers to orepare a stockpile
of filmed. commercials ching the month of February. Therefore,
there are no studio facilities evailable during this entire
month. Fortunately, in anticivation of our possible needs: in
this direction, we committed ourselves over a week ago for a
studio on the 1Ath and 19th.
