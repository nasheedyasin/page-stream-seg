R&D MEMORANDUM May 20, 1969

Charcoal Filters

Further to our memorandum of May 12, 1969, discussions with Messrs. Domeck,
Brown and Johnston, and continyed R&D evaluations we recommend the following
action.

Four samples should be manufactured, in which the main variables will be D
EN-1, and 556 vs. TLP paper. A repeat of 323007 will serve as a control
series which is:

Gode 323009 323011
Blend DUK-3
Casing 82
Flavor 950
Paper 6 553 TLP 553 TLE

The filters will all be of the stion: an 8 mm bed of BPL coai-base
carbon treated with 33% included water and 1% propylene glycol, betwen two 8.5 mm
sections of 3.9 x 40,000 acetate. R&D evaluations and Manufacturing require-
ments will select either 20 x 50 or 12 x 30 mesh carbon.

The use of TLP paper should increase puff mmber, reduce tar, carbon monoxide
and nitrogen oxides,

The casing and flavor for the DUX-3 blend are modified to increase the flavor
level.

The problem of external testing of charcoal filters has been aired with Market
Research. No decision has been reached yet as to the test meLhod which will be
ad. recommend, howaver, that each sample be assigned a Market Research
and that quanlities sufficient for 100 respondents be prepared, It is
anticipated that two samples will be sclected at B&W From the four made, for
the actual market tests,
