Dear Sirs:

Re: Tipping Paper TP_1028 361 PE

We are interested in fabricating some sample cigarettes using your
tipping uaterial TP 1028 361 PE. I suppose this particular tipping is
electrostatically perforated but for our purpose, we need this
mechanically perforated. The specification is given below:

* Color White as in 1028361
Width (mu) 64

Length (meters) 500

Type of perforation Mechanical

Number of rows 3

Band width (mm) 2

Permeability (Coresta) 23800

Distance band begins from

edge of bobbin (m) 7

I shall be grateful if you would send the bobbin to me at your earliest
convenience.

Thank you.

Very truly yours,

rae
