paper chromatogram to determine whether or not another
.chromatography step is necessary.

When sufficient purity has been obtained, the extract is
filtered over a amall colum (5-7 mim. dia. x 30-50 mm. Long)
of silica gel to remove paper fibres and evaporated to
dryness under a stream of nitrogen. The residue is
redissolved in a measured volume of cyclohexane and the
concentration of benzo(a)pyrene is determined from the
U.V. spectrum of this solution.

ave Spectro gradt,
All solvents used in the above procedure, and the paper
chromatograms should be protected from U.V. light.
Dr. Hoffmann reports that through the use of cit, labeled
“benzo(a)pyrene,” he has determined the loss during the
analysis to be in the range of 30-40% of the original
benzo(a)pyrene present in the tar. It is, therefore, felt
that in order for the method to be used with the,desired
analytical accuracy, a known concentration of , labeled
"benzo(a)pyrene," should be added at the beginning of the
analysis and the loss determined for each sample run.
Dr. Hoffmann has not as yet determined in which step or
steps of this procedure the losses occur, but it is his
thought that the greatest loss is in the removal of the
Sample from the paper chromatograms.

In general, we feel that Dr. Hoffmann's method 1s a good
one and generally applicable te our present needs, although
minor variations might be made toadapt the method to
specific needs.

Both Dr. Spears and myself wish to express our appreciation
for the complete cooperation given us by Dr. Hoffmann and
his staff both in the form of answers to our questions and
data obtained by them.

Respectfully,
