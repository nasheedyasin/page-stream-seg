The Settling Defendants are unable to take the risk that -- were they to consent
now to the release of the escrowed funds -- a second putative appellant might thereafter
(but on or before September 8) file a notice of appeal in this action and persuade an
appellate court that Mr. Chesebro was in fact a "party" within the meaning of Rule

4(a)(3), with the result that by operation of that Rule the second appellant's appeal would
be timely.

Accordingly, if -- as the Settling Defendants hope -- ue further appeals are filed in
this action on or before September &, the Setiling Defendants will promptly thereafter
instruct the Escrow Agent that Final Approval has occurred and that the appropriate funds
may be released from escrow. Any signed escrow instruction that you may already have
received should be held by you until further instruction from us.

In addition, this letter also serves to confirm our mutual understanding that the
Court’s August 28, 1998 Order does not require release of the escrowed funds in the
absence of the Settling Defendants’ written consent to the release of those funds.
