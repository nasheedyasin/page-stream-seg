’ «= Dear Axel:

"In accordance with your October 21, 1981 telex to Mr. John Judd,
enclosed herewith are two documents which best summarize the present
controversy at the Federal Trade Commission with respect to the
determination of "tar" and nicotine values for BARCLAY and other low
"tar" cigarettes in the United States.

1. The letter to FTC from Arnold & Porter, representing Philip
Morris, Inc., dated July 10, 1981; and

2. Brown & Williamson's letter to FTC dated August 24, 1981.
I hope the foregoing documents will provide a sufficient background
- on this matter for the time being. In due course we will prepare a

full statement of the situation and certainly will keep you apprised
of all significant developments in this matter.

Sincerely,

ha@é1l L. Hendershot
International Counsel
