Subject: Tabacool Evaluation Date: june 29, 1977

Mr. L. C. Cook From: Rk. D. Gourley

Tanasa, our licensee in Peru, has requested a limited analysis of
“Tabacool" to evaluate claims made in regard to this material. This was
accomplished by obtaining WINSTON KS blend which had been prccessed in
the factory to the point of making cigarettes, and dividing into two
segments to ensure blend uniformity.

One segment (L-11010-B) was sprayed with 0.5% "Tabacool" based on
tobacco weight at 12.9% moisture, dispersed in a solution of 3 parts
alcohol and 2 parts propylene glycol. The other segment L-11010-A was
sprayed with just alcohol and propylene glycol at the same ratio to be
utilized as a control.

- Cigarettes were fabricated from each segment for evaluation by the
Expert Smoking Panel and Chemical analyses.

In the smoking evaluations, panel members significantly preferred
L-11010-A in all categories and they indicated their main objection to
L-11010-B was due to a pronounced offtaste.

Results of the Chemical analyses are as follows:
