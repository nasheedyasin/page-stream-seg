Experimental Procedure

Material.

Thirty grams of reaction "A" mixture were mixed thoroughly with 300 mi
of methanol/water (70/30) and filtered with suction. The methanol was
evaporated under reduced pressure. The sample was extracted successively
with 400 ml each of diethyl ether, chloroform, and toluene. The aqueous
layer was concentrated about 5 fold for preparative gas chromatography.

Preparative Chromatography

About 30 ul of the above sample was chromatographed on a 10 ft. x 4 mm
I,D. glass column packed with 15% Carbowax 20M on 100/120 mesh AW/DMCS
chromosorb W using an HP-7624 gas chromatograph. The column temperature
was progtammed from 60째C to 230째C at 4째C/min. and held at the upper limir.
Helium was used as carrier gas at 50 ml/min. The subfractions were
collected in 2 mm glass U-tubes cooled in an ethanol/dry ice bath. Twenty
wl of methylene chloride was introduced to wash the inner wall of the
U-tube immediately after collection. The tubes were then sealed at the
ends with parafilm and kept in a dry ice box until analyzed by capillary
GC/MS.

Each of the subfractions collected in the U-tubes was further
chromatographed on a Om x 0.2 mm 1.D. fused silica capillary columa
of SP-2100 in a Finnigan 4023 GC/MS/data system. With helium as a
carrier gas at 1-3 ml/min. the column temperature was programmed from
40째C (held for 4 min.) to 200 C at a rate of 2-4 C/min. Electron
impact mode of MS was carried out on all the samples while chemical
Yonization mode on some samples to verify tiolecular weight assignment.
