Mr. Michael Kennedy

AS you may be aware, MARLBORO is the world's leading
cigarette and the MARLBORO Red Roof Design is one of the most
famous of all American trademarks. Moreover, while cigarettes
are our major product, substantial business is done in several
areas and, as you may also be aware, MARLBORO sponsors several
race cars, racing teams and automobile racing events around the
world. Among the racing cars and racing teams sponsored are the
MARLBORO McLaren racing team and the current CART-Indy car
champion.

MARLBORO, the MARLBORO Red Roof Design and the combination
thereof are all trademarks owned by Philip Morris. Accordingly,
the usage of our trademarks, trade dress and words and designs
confusingly similar therewith infringe our rights under federal,
state and common law.

Further, smoking is an adult decision, and all of our
cigarette advertising and promotion are directed at informed adult
smokers. Your company's mentioned preducts would appear to be
intended primarily for children and the use thereon of our
trademarks and trade dress is therefore contrary to our
advertising and promotion policies.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we would likely be amenable
to resolving this matter on an amicable basis and without resort
to litigation, on the following conditions:

(a) Provide us with the names and addresses of any
manufacturer or supplier of the mentioned products, if
other than your company;

(b) Undertake to cease all further manufacture, sale and
distribution of the mentioned products after the
exhaustion of your current stock on hand.

I look forward to hearing from you promptly, in the hopes
that this matter may be expeditiously resolved.
