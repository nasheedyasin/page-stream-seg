Dear Mr. Bleustein:

Enclosed for your files are stats of the point-of-sale material we
will produce for a sports bag promotion for Harley-Davidson
Cigarettes.

Also included are stats of advertising being used in our test markets.
The attached list matches creative to the market, advertising vehicle

Sincerely,
