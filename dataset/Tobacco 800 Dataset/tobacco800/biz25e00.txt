Dear Mr. Faso:

A bill currently making its way through the New York Assembly poses a severe threat to
the promotional marketing and advertising industries.

This measure, Assembly Bill 7139, seeks to prevent tobacco use by minors by, among
other things, banning all cigarette advertising with the exception of ads that appear in
newspapers or magazines.

This proposal is ill-conceived and potentially destructive to my industry, which employs
thousands of people in New York State. Studies both abroad and in the United States
have determined that cigarette advertising plays a minimal role in an individual's decision
to smoke. Peer influence, and the influence of parents and older siblings, is by far the
dominant factor. Banning advertising, therefore, will not affect the incidence of smoking
by youths.

Besides being ill-suited to achieve its stated purpose, this proposal is unconstitutional.
Since the 1970's, the courts have ruled that commercial speech is protected under the
First Amendment. Unfortunately, by the time the courts get around to overturning this
measure, the economic damage will already have been done.to my industry and many
others.

I hope you will take the above into consideration and oppose the passage of Assembly

Bill 7139.

sb
