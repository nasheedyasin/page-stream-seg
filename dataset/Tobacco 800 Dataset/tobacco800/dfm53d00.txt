Re: SALEM 100's Competitive Product Test

In June, 1979, SALEM 100's 19 mg was competitively tested against Kool 100's.
Relative to established action standards, results indicate that:

Action Standards Overall Ratings _

Higher overall rating vs. Kool 100's among
e SALEM 100's smokers e SALEM rated higher than Kool

e@ Non-Kool competitive 100mm full e SALEM rated at parity with Kool
flavor menthol smokers

Although SALEM 100's did not meet its action standard of superiority among non-
Kool competitive smokers, the brand was rated superior to Kool 100's on several
important product attributes which, apparently, had no positive effect on the

overall rating:

Non-Kool Competitive Full Flavor Menthol 100's Smokers
Relative to Kool 100's Relative to SALEM 100's

SALEM 100's was rated Kool 100's was rated

Smoother Too Strong
Cooler Harsher
Milder Uneven Burn

Sweeter Taste

Hence, on individual product attributes, current SALEM 100's at 19 mg does appear to
be competitive with Kool 100's among non-Kool competitive full flavor menthol 100's
smokers. Therefore, the brand recommends not changing the current 19 mg product, but
continue to monitor the SALEM 100's 16 mg test market, scheduled for preliminary re-
sults on 2/1/80 with final results on 5/15/80. Assuming good test market results,
the product will be introduced nationally in June, 1980.
