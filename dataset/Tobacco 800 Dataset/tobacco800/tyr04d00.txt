INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM

Subject: Deposit at the NRRL, USDA, Peoria, Ill. of Date: March 4, 1969
microbiological cultures to be referred to
in U.S. Patent Applications.

Dr. Herbert Bluhm

In a phone conversation today with Dr. Hesseltine, formerly in charge
of the NRRL Culture Collections Laboratory and currently head of their
Fermentations Laboratories, cultures referred to in patent applications
should be sent to him or to the Culture Collection Laboratory. A letter
shotld accompany the culture stating: oO

Name (if possible)

Strain designation

Culture medium

Special handling methods, if required

Do not state the following:

Purpose for which culture is to be used.

How to reselect strain with specific activity, if
the method will disclose the process or purpose.
ascribed in theâ€™ patent application.

The culture should be sent as slant cultures (minimum of two) from which
30 lyophilized tubes will be prepared. This will minimize variations and
mutation. A Letter confirming receipt and giving a number designation and
disposition of the culture will be sent promptly.

"According to existing regulations the culture will be immediately
available to the public. However, a list of such cultures is not published.
Only the depositor, NRRL and the U.S. Patent Office will know of its existence
until the patent is issued.

Dr. Hesseltine advised that we not state the NRRL culture number in
foreign patent applications unless absolutely necessary because many foreign
patents issue more quickly than U.S. Patents, thereby disclosing availability
of the culture. . .

Cultures, such as our #262, which are subject to continuous variation and
require periodic reselection by special techniques to maintain the high activ-
ities claimed in patent applications, aan be redeposited at the time of patent
issuance giving details of the method of reselection.
