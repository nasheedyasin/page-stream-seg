Dear Mr. Cobbs:

Did a bit of hyperbole creep into your report that a "few"
companies "have already bowed to militant nonsmokers and ceded
them their own territory in offices.and factories," a situation
that you then called a "war" between smokers and nonsmokers that
has “invaded the corporation"?

Perhaps the battlefield analogy was drawn because the author of
your November 29 piece, "office smokers feel the heat," relied
almost exclusively on the views expressed by fringe anti-smoking
groups such as "ASH" and "GASP."

The real issue -- unanswered. by the article -- is whether or not
the vast majority of business managers are going to acquiesce to
the demands of a small, yet vocal minority of anti-smokers, not
nonsmokers, who are interested in imposing their Ideas on the
rest of us. Perhaps managers will continue to use good sense in
handling, on a case-by-case basis, what is, in reality, a minor
question. Courtesy, common sense, and a mutual respect and
tolerance for the preferences of others have been successfully
employed for centuries.

The public has voted on proposed smoking restrictions involving
private property six times in the past five years -- twice in
statewide California elections. With more than 15.5 million ballots

Cast, all six measures were given thumbs down.

If the anti-smokers were operating a sports franchise, their 0-6
record would put them in the cellar of their activist league.

Sincere) 2
