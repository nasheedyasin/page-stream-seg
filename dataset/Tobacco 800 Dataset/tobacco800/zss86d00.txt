Re: California Campaign Contributions to The Tobacco
Institute

Dear Art:

The Tobacco Institute has been making contributions to
California candidate and ballot measure committees during 1991.
Since these contributions are being made from Institute general
treasury funds, California law requires that the contributions be
pro rated among the members of the Institute based upon dues
assessments received by the Institute during the period of the
campaign contributions.

Below is a chronological listing of your company’s pro rata
share of The Tobacco Institute California contributions:

Date Amount

01/23/91 $1,766.05
04/02/91 $1,346.31

7/01/91 $1,682.34
$4,794.70

As you know, this firm monitors your company’s campaign
activity in California and discloses those contributions on a
California Major Donor Campaign Statement if certain thresholds
are met. The above captioned amounts will be disclosed both on
The Tobacco Institute’s campaign statement and also on your
company’s Major Donor Campaign Statement. If you have any
questions regarding this allocation, please do not hesitate to
contact Kirk Alan Pessner, our Senior Paralegal/Administrator of
our Political Reports Unit or me.

Very uly yours,

(hig Mv t—
