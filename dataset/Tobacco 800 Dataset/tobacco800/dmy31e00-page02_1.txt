Dear Dr. Thomas:

We have completed our review of several Immunomodulatory Screen-
ing Tests, recently submitted to Lorillard, and have the follow-
ing comments and corrections: ;
SN35LOR (A155)

Page 12, Table 2: The outlier indicated by footnote b is missing
from the table. Please indicate where this footnote belongs, or
remove the footnote notation if an outlier was not present.

SN38LOR (A81')

Page 5, Section IIA, line 2: Please correct the spelling of
August. /

SN40LOR (A904

1. Page 3, Line 2: Please insert the word "unexpected" before
"Test Article toxicity".

2. Page 9, Section III, Results and Discussion: The results
section in some areas is difficult to follow. Perhaps this
section would read better if it began with a discussion of

_ the unexpected mortality caused by the Test Article, fol-
lowed by what was observed in the surviving animals. For
example:

Figure 1 displays the mortality of mice following treatment
with Test Article A90. Due to unexpected Test Article
toxicity, all mice in the 2500 mg/kg dose group and 50% of
mice in the 1250 mg/kg dose group died within one hour of
dosing. Just prior to death the mice experienced hyperkine-
tic activity. An autopsy of one mouse in the 1250 mg/kg
c.se group revealed a lighter than normal liver color with a
wvi.ter texture. Body weights of surviving mice were mea-
sured on dosing day 3 and 5 and were not different from

vehicle controls. Table 1, summarizes the results of the ~—
