DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL AMINO ACIDS IN SUGAR-AMINO
ACID REACTION MIXTURE METCAL

Summary

At the request of the Product Department, the commercial tobacco flavoring
mixture METCAL was analyzed to determine levels of residual amino acids.

A preparative cation exchange chromatographic procedure was modified to
Separate the amino acids, AutoAnalyzer equipment was used to construct 4
post-column ninhydrin reaction unit to monitor amino acide eluted from the
colum, Levels of the residual amino acids determined are as follows:
valine (1.5%), aspartic acid (0.45%), phenylalanine (0.18%), glutamic acid
(<0,03%), proline (<0,07%), glutamine (<0.03%), and histidine (<0.03%).

troduction
METCAL is a commercial flavoring mixture of the Maillard reaction type!,

which is generally prepared by heating sugar(s) and amino acid(s) in
mixture. The starting amino acids in METCAL were aspartic acid, valine,

phenylalanine, glutamic acid, proline, glutamine, and histidine’. In

literature, three categories of analytical methods have been used to
determine levels of amino acids in various samples: ion exchange chromato-
graphy, gas chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography.
Amino acid analyzers and various improved procedures of ion exchange
chromatography? are so far the most widely used methods. In fact,

modern amino acid analyzers incorporate advantages from both ion exchange
chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. In gas
chromatographic determinations of amino acids, samples have to be deriva-
tized to increase volatility. Since acid-catalyzed esterification could
hydrolyze and convert glutamine to glutamic acid, these gas chromato-—
graphic methods would give only the sum of glutamine and glutamic

acid’, High performance liquid chromatography which employs reversed
phase or ton-paired principles for amino acid analysis still needs better
