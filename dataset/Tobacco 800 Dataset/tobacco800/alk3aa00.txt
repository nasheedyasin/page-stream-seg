Dear Dr. Homburger:

The ICR mice arrived from ARS/Sprague-Dawley and we had the
tissues tested for gs antigen by Dr. Huebner's laboratory and the
sera of the retired breeders tested for their viral antibody spec-
trum by Dr. Parker at Microbiological Associates, Inc.

The sera were all negative for PVM, Reo 3, GS VII, K, Polyoma,
KRV, H-f, SVc,; M.Ad, LCM and Vaccinia. Seven of the eleven mice
showed HAI titers of 1:10 to 1:40 for Sendi. Nine of the eleven mice
showed titers of 1:80 to 1:640 for MVM. Three of the eleven mice
gave 1:10 to 1:20 CF titers for MHV.

The gs antigen CF results are presented in the attached table.
[t would appear that these mice are very switched-on for gs antigen
even as weanlings. This makes it very difficult to evaluate any
effects that chemical carcinogens may have on the spleen, thymus
or liver tissues although studies for the presence of gs antigen in
the tumors could still be done. A mouse strain showing less gs .
antigen would serve our purpose better for some future studies.

Sincerely yours,

Carrie E. Whitmire,
Project Director
