WACHTELL. LIPTON, MASEN @ Nave

requirement that only when a pri ed document is created ip. furtherance of an ongoing
or future crime or fraud will ite piviege be abrogated, and created an entirely
unprecedented mule thar destroys the privilege merely upon a showing that a document
“relates” (however tangentially) to the subject maner of an alleged crime or fraud. Such a
tule deswoys the entire concent of a privileae, because every time a client accused of a
crime or fraud had a discussion with his attomey on a subject “relating” ic chat alleged
crime or fraud the privilege would be forfeited.

In short, the petition is not based upon minor, technical claims of error that would
change the result below only with to a handful of privileged materials. Rather, the
claims of error go [a the very heart o whether Congress (ar anyene else) can credit or rely
on apy of the pnvilege rulings in the Minnesota ial court.

The tobacco companies, CTR and TI have asserted and hereby continue to assert
attomey-client privilege and anormey work product protection with respect to the documents
sought by the Commitire’s February 19 subpoenas. {f the Committee nonetheless
averrules these claims of privilege and directs the companies to comply with thase
subpoenas, the companies will comply with such 2 ruling and direcnon; none of the
companies, CTR nor TI wishes to stand in contempt of 4 formal Comminee ruling or
disection.

Accordingly, we are confident that the Committe appreciates the important
appellate issues under review here and, as such, we request that the Comminee either
extend the deadline for any response to its subpoenas or refrain from issuing any ruling or
direction with respect to the companies’ privilege claims here wntil the conclusion of the
Minnesota appellate process, which we hope will be an expedited one.

Very wuly yours,
