Dear Robert:

Per our telephone conversation, 1 have enclosed a sample bottle of ink
from material currently used by the B.A.T. company in Hong Kong. This
is in response to a favorable trial they did using the VICEROY blue ink
used by B&W in Macon on high speed makers.

B.A.T. Hong Kong management were pleased with the initial operational
properties of the trial ink but request the ink shade be adjusted to
more closely match their currently used ink. Thus, 1 would be grateful
iÂ£ you could provide me with a one kilogram ink sample in a color to
match the current B.A.T. Hong Kong ink while maintaining the machine
properties offered by the ink used by B&W, I would also appr
specification sheet and an MSDS sheet for this new material.

I will then forward the test ink sample to my contact in Kong Kong for
their evaluation.

Thank you for your assistance and attention to this matter.

Yours truly,

Nase A Yr inn
