Evaluation of M.dified BWC Carbon
(Pehiing Solution Modified) for
Filtracion of Ccndensibles in the Gis Phase.

A suggested modification of BWG carbon (consisting of 70% BWC, 20% Na,CO, and
10% CuSO, °5H,0) was evaluated for filtration of the condensibles in the gas
phase. $nis’mixture was speculated to simulate the action of Fehiing‘s solution
on aldehydes. Aldehydes react with Fehlings solution forming sodium saits

while reducing the cupric {on to the cuprous ion.

The filtration evaluation was performed in two ways. The modified carbon was
made into filter rods (30% loading) and compared with normal 30% BNC rode by
smoking 20 mm sections on Avalon tobacco sections. The second method consisted
of sandwiching 30 mg of the powdered carbon (both normal and modified) between
two 10 um sections of white acetate 6/5 Pz. and smoking on an Avalon tobacco
section, The 30 mg loading sioulates the content of an 8 ma section of carbon
rod at the 30% level in an Avalon cigarette.

The data obtained by both smoking methods showed that the modified BWC carbon
was less efficient than normal BWC carbon. The short gas residence time and
the non-ajueous modification probably circumvent the action of the basic copper
sulfate on the aldehydes.
