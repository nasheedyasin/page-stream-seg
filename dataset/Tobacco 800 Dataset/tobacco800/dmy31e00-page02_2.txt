with compound A90 or vehicle. Prior to Listeria challenge,
12 and 20 mice in the 1250 and 2500 mg/kg dose group died

due to Test Article toxicity. However, the Test Article had
no significant effect on mortality or mean survival time
following Listeria challenge in the surviving animals
including those in the 625 mg/kg dose group. Tables 2a and
2b summarize the anti-SRBC PFC response: 2a) body weight, 6

modulate the immune response as measured by the PFC and host
resistance assays.
