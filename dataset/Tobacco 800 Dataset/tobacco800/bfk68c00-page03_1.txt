PRESIDENT AND November 10, 1995

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

I am writing to ask for your help in opposing a very serious threat to our business -- the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) unprecedented and illegal assertion of
regulatory control over the cigarette industry.

Mr. Arthur’ f Stevens

On its face, the FDA’s action would seem only to affect our Philip Morris U.S.A. tobacco
operations. But I can assure you, if the FDA succeeds in its efforts, the effects could be much
broader.

As most of you know, in August, FDA Commissioner David Kessler, with President
Clinton’s support, asserted jurisdiction over tobacco products and unveiled a plan for FDA
regulation. Commissioner Kessler claims that the FDA’s plan is designed to prevent minors
from smoking.

TI hope that you will agree that turning back Commissioner Kessler’s efforts to regulate our
tobacco products is of paramount importance. I also hope that we can count on you to take
action by writing to your members of Congress expressing your opinion that FDA regulation
of cigarettes is both illegal and unwarranted. You can write to your elected officials at the
following addresses:

Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato Senator Daniel Moynihan
520 Hart Senate Office Building 464 Russell Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510 Washington, DC 20510

The Honorable Carolyn B. Maloney
Longworth | House Office Building
Room, 1504

Washington, DC 20515

For your convenience, | have provided some writing points, which, if you agree with the
message, you can feel free to use in your letters to your legislators.

TES&sOTS

Philip Morris agrees absolutely that minors should not smoke and should not have access
to cigarettes. In fact, in June of this year Philip Morris U.S.A. announced a major new
initiative -- called Action Against Access -- to address the issue of youth access to cigarettes.
