Dear Dave:

1 hope that all is going well with you.

Lance Reynolds asked that I provide you with a description of our
GEMINI cigarette for modeling of flows. The specifications and a
diagram of the filter components are attached. Sample filters are
being sent under separate cover.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Sincerely,

Kibh, St Gale
