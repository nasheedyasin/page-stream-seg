RE: SALEM FULL FLAVOR BUSINESS BUILDING TEST RECOMMENDATION
—— ee ee ENDL LUN

Recommendation

The Brand recommends an investment of $953M to determine through test
marketing the viability of implementing a national business building
program on SALEM FULL FLAVOR. January is recommended for start of
test marketing. Funds are available in current Brand budgets.

Program Objectives

1. Maintain Brand's share of category which will require increasing
volume (+2.5%) and share of market (+0.1 share point).

Increase Brand contribution long term.

Achieve a reasonable payout period (less than 3 years) for this
incremental investment.

Strategies/Rationale

1. Increase total SALEM FULL FLAVOR marketing spending in Year I by
55% ($8MM).

@ Previous media heavy-up tests indicate the Brand is re-
sponsive to additional spending.

ay

50% increase required to read a significant share change.

Results in $12MM Brand contribution increase over a 3-
year period despite increased spending in the out years .
and payout in 18 months if objectives are met. See

Exhibit I. ,

2. Concentrate the incremental funds against young adult smokers (18-
34 year olds). ‘

@ Newport and Kool's high developments. among young-adults
appear to be the primary cause for their category share
growth and notably, Newport's growth within the total
market. SALEM FULL FLAVOR, however, is underdeveloped
versus competition among this segment since spending is
executed broadly. See Exhibit II.
