U.S.A,

Dear Doctor Hockett:

Safely back in Winnipeg where we are shivering in ~20° weather, I wish
to thank you for inviting me to the conference on the macrophage, Taken as a
whole I thought the conference was valuable although I must admit to some synaptic
overload during the first part of the Friday morning session,

As I left you asked for comments, so perhaps I may pinpoint the particular
areas that impressed me,

On the first day, the work of Joseph Guarneri continues to impress me;
here is a wealth and depth of knowledge and the combination of in-vivo and vitro
models has much to offer in the elucidation of disturbed macrophagic function,

It became clear, as the discussion progressed, that there are significant gaps
in our knowledge about bactericidal mechanisms in the lung, Is it related solely
to the macrophage or are other factors such as surfactant .involved too?

The two papers on scanning electron microscopy were fascinating and, of
course, very beautifully presented. I think it was interesting to see the surface
changes in the adapted or angry macrophages but the long range significance of this
is doubtful, S.E.M. may perhaps, because of its low magnification, be of some use
in quantitative studies, but I don’t see it as a major imvestigatiye tool.

After lunch on Thursday, the papers of Cross and Mustafa emphasized an
important parameter, the metabolic adaptive changes that occur when the macrophage
is irritated in any way. It is important to look at the macrophage in this way
since it is becoming apparent that the adaptive capacity of the macrophage is great
and only when this capacity is exceeded may we expect treuble.
