NENTS IN MAILLARD REACTION

The aqueous extract of Maillard reaction "A" mixture was subjected ta
preparative gas chromatography and the effluent collected to obtain
various fractions. GC/mass spectral identification of the flavor
components produced in fractions #4-#16 was reported earlier (isieh,

File Note, March 28, 1980). No good identification was made on fractions
#1-83 due to their high volatility which caused partial sample loss before
GC/MS analysis.

Since the first 6 fractions gave particularly favorable organoleptic
evaluation as cigarette additives (Cravotta, Memo, March 19, 2980),

they were prepared in larger amounts and subjected to capillary GC/MS
analysis under improved sample handling and GC conditions. Component s
identified using this approach are reported below. Experimental procedures
are described in the Appendix.

Figure 1 shows the Preparative gas chromatogram. Please note that fraction
#4 was further resolved into subfractions #4-1 and #4 Table I lists in
the order of increasing GC retention time the flavor components identified
by capillary GC/MS. Components tentatively identified are indicated by an
asterisk (*), For fractions #4-#6, newly identified components (not
reported previously) are labeled by an ampersand (&). Relative abundance
of the identified components within each fraction is shows by peak size:

+, small; ++, medium; and +4, large.
