The Honorable Carol M. Thomas
secretary

The Federal Trade Commission
Washington, DC 20580

Dear Mr. Thomas:

This refers to your letter dated 8 November 1979 regarding our
request for confidential treatment of the Roper Study and the
Commission's plan to release it on the basis that "all of your
company’s significant competitors in the cigarette business"
have it. American Tobacco Company is a substantial competitor
and unless the FTC has already given the report to American it
does not possess it,

The Roper Study was privately funded and undertaken for a private
business function. Your release will benefit our competitors who
do not have it and will benefit other business adversaries of
Brown & Williamson. We protest your release of a study obtained
under compulsory process in a non-public investigation.

Brown & Williamson has already addressed a motion to Judge
Barrington Parker relating to the Roper Study and related issues
of confidentiality and you are hereby informed that if you
release the Roper Study before we have had an opportunity for a
hearing on this matter we will press for appropriate judicial
sanction. ,

There is no urgency in disclosing the Roper Study or information
contained in it and you surely can wait until the court has ruled.

Very truly yours,

Znue¥ ligpee

Ernest Pepples
