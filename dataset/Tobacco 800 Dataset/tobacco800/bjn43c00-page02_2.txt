Addressees:

Enclosed is TITL’s “Tar”, Nicotine and Carbon Monoxide draft report for Market Sample #40. The
sample pickup period was between January 10 and January 22, 1997.

Appearing, as appendices to the report are company results, brand rankings, butt lengths, brand codes,

and a TOB_HT protocol. Rankings are from the original calculations using at least four decimal places.
If ties existed, they were ranked using standard deviations, and if still tied, alphabetically. All
rounding for the reported values uses the original calculations. If rounding is performed using the
reported data, which has already been rounded once, then values may occasionally be different from
those listed in the “Rounded Test Resulis” section.

Included are TITL files on a 14Mb, 3.5-inch disk, readable on an IBM compatible computer. Two
unique files are stored on the disk in three different formats. One file contains TPM, Water, and Puff
Counts in addition to the “Tar”, Nicotine, and CO daia. The other file contains the rounded “Tar”
Nicotine, and CO values. The formats are Lotus “*.wki”, ASCH “*.csv”, and Excel 97 “*.xls”.

Sincerely,

Bilin A Daggte
