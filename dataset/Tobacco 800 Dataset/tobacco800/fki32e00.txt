RE: Corporate Policy on Use of Trademark/
Sponsorship Logos

Dear Ms yysens Louse

Thank you for your assistance in providing your
company's policy concerning the use of trademarks and
corporate/sponsor logos on your company's products. The
issue was not, after all, raised at the hearing. If it
does resurface, I will attempt to ascertain the actual
item on which our MARLBORO trademark is alleged to have
been used, and I will pass on any information received in

this regard.

Thanks again.
