Tactical Issues

How should AMERICAN Filters be incorporated into what had
been conceived as an AMERICAN Lights test?

How many different executions should be prepared? And
should they run in succession or rotation? Which
specific shots are available to us? The final "price"
copy lines also need to be discussed.

Learning from prior problems with stock photography, can
we check to see if we might catch flack from either the
slide house or the original photographer for "altering"
the shots by retouching the cigarette onto the photo
subject?

Apropos of recent problems with the background on some of
the new MALIBU units, let's be absolutely certain that
placement of the government mandatories is carefully
considered and reflected on the final comps.

BE) Production cost and timing estimates will also be
required.

You've indicated that you'll review these issues with the appropriate
Agency personnel.

Please get back to us to set up a review of these issues.

Sincerely,

T. M. Keane
