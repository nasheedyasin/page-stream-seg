The companies are therefore willing to
underwrite the costs of that proposed independent
testing program.

We are therefore proposing the following
specific program to protect whatever interests the
Chemical Research and Development Corporation, Dr.
Hudson, or others associated with you may have, as
well as the interests of the public and the industry.

1. The Hazleton Laboratories of Falls
Church, Virginia, an independent scientific testing
agency of acknowledged competence and repute, is to
be employed as the testing agency. An adequate proto~
col covering testing methodology, sample size, the use
of control cigarettes, the determination of any poten-
tial toxicity, and any organoleptic testing to be in-
cluded will be prepared by the scientific research
representatives of the participating cigarette manu-
facturing companies.

2, The Chemical Research and Development
Corporation would undertake, upon-recelving adequate
assurance against any disclosure of any confidential
information as to the composition or character of the
"CGhemosol" fuel additive, to furnish all necessary
quantities of "Chemosol" for the preparation of test
cigarettes. The cigarette manufacturing companies
will, in turn, undertake to assist in making available
the most modern developed cigarette smoking machines
and other needed testing equipment.

3. The participating companies will pay
and share, in accordance with a formula to be deter-
mined among themselves, the full costs of the testing
program, The contract with Hazleton Laboratories is
to be with the participating cigarette manufacturing
companies.
