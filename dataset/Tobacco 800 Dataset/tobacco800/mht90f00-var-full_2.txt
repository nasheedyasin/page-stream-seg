Background

Results of the recent monitor (MRD 1987-146K) found KOOL KS to be significantly
preferred over Newport among franchise smokers. However, no significant difference
in preference was seen among Newport KS smokers.

Since the goal is to offer a Superior KOOL product relative to Newport, further
Product improvement work was initiated.

Improved modifications include reduction in stem, restructuring of flue-cured and

burley grades, processed stem in the form of FC-SDS and a substitution of
peppermint of].

Summary & Hypothesis

1) Among franchise, one of the improvements (A or B) will be as likeable or better
than Current KOOL KS and,

2) Among Newport smokers, one of the improvements (A or B) will be superior over
Current KOOL KS.

Likeability and preference ratings will be suported with improvements in less
irritation, more smoothness and better tobacco taste.

Proposal

Through product improvement efforts, which have been confirmed through Dupont
testing, it is recommended that:

1) Candidate “A" and "B" be tested versus Current KOOL KS in a round robin fashion
among franchise smokers, and

2) Candidates "A" and “B" be tested versus Current among Newport KS and other
Menthol (Salem and Marlboro) KS smokers.

Note [erat “and "B" are the same except "A contains FC-WTS and “BY contains
