Dear Bob:

I am submitting my expenses for the most recent CYR meeting, i.e.,
those expenditures not covered by the master account.

Flight ($980 x 2) . $1,960.00
Meals 206.30
Tips and miscellany : 15.60

Surface transportation ; 131.00
($31 + $35 + $31 +$34)

TOTAL, a $2,312.90

I found the meeting this tima to be a densely packed process that
was quite tiring. The most eventful and happy part of the get-together
was the agreement between Bill Hobbs and SAB that Dr. Glenn should be
provisionally appointed to the position of Director. I am personally «.
wholeheartedly behind this decision.

The next meeting is not so far away, but I am not at the present time
giving any thought to it. I look forward to seeing you then in September.

’ Sincerely yours,

QD. Feldman, M.D.
