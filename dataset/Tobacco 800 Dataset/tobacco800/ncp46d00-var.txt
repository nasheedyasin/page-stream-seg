Dear Dr. Lisanti:

I am writing to request permission to purchase a Packard -TRI~CARB 300G
microprocessor liquid scintillation counter at a price of $16,250 on my. -
CTR grant 1126A. When I ori inally wrote this grant application, the cost
of an equivalent scintillation counter was $15,000. This was the amount
requested in the grant and .this was approved. Since that time there has
been a price increase and so I would like permission to.spend an extra

’ $1,250. 0n the purchase of this counter. I would use funds from the Mater
and Supplies Category of.my current grant so no extra funding will be re-
wired for this purchase. This counter wift pertorm a vital role in
quantitating radioactivity in our experiments and will allow us.to rapidly
and efficiently assess our results.

Yours truly,

Linda M. Hall
Associate Professor of Genetics’
