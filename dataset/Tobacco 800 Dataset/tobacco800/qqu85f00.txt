Section Sales Manager Â£. Doerr, Jr. phoned this morning and
advised that Merchandising Supervisor Forrest A. Ward will

not attend the MONTCLAIR meeting in Mr. Doerr's Burlington,
New Jersey, office on May 6 inasmuch as Mr. Ward has previously
been exposed to MONTCLAIR work and his time can be better
spent on Monday, May 6, calling on the trade.

I gave Mr. Doerr an 0.K. on this.
