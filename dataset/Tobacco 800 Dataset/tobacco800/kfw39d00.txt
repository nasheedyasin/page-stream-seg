MEMORANDUM TO THE LEAF AND BLENDS COMMITTEE

In the absence of the Chairman, Mr. Wm. D. Hobbs discussed with members
of the Committee the following recommendation:

Change CAMEL, WINSTON, and SALEM burley blends to utilize 1967
Mexican burley tobaccos at a rate of less than 1% of the total
blend. At this rate, the inventory of Mexican tobaccos will
be exhausted by the end of 1971. Attached are copies of the
recommended blend changes and results of tests using Mexican

tobaccos in the blend at a higher rate than in the recommended
blend.

The Committee approved the above recommendation to become effective
August 27, 1971.
