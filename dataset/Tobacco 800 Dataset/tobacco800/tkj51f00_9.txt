Experimental P.

Ma

Thirty grams of reaction

of methanol/water (70/30) and filtered with suction. The methanol was
evaporated under reduced pressure. The sample was extracted successive}
with 400 ml each of diethyl ether, chloroform, and toluene. aqueous
layer was concentrated about 5 fold for preparative gas chromatography.

Preparative Gas Chromatography

About 30 ul of the above sample was chromatographed on a 10 ft.

I.D. glass column packed with 15% Carbowax 20M on 100/120 mesh AW/DMC
chromosorb W using an HP-7624 gas chromatograph. The co}umn temperature
was programmed from 60°C to 230°C at 4°C/min. and held at the upper limit.
Helium was used as carrier gas at 50 ml/min. The subfractions were
collected in 2 mm glass U-tubes cooled in an ethanol/dry ice bath. Twenty
ul of methylene chloride was introduced to wash the inner wall of the
U-tube immediately after collection. The tubes were then sealed at the
ends with afilm and kept in a dry ice box until analyzed by capillary
GC/MS.

Each of the subfractions collected in the U-tubes was further
chromatographed gn a 50m x 0.2 mm I.D. fused silica capillary colomn
of SP-2100 in a Finnigan 4023 GC/MS/data system. With helium as a
carrier gas at 1-3 ml/min. the column temperaturg was programmed from
40°C {held for 4 min.) to 200°C at a rate of 2-4°C/min. Electron
impact mode of MS was carried out on ail the samples while chemical
ionization mode on some samples to verify molecular weight assignment.
