Project 2903 - Service to Manufacturing

G-7

A test run with G-7 extract in the aeration evaporator at 90-3 showed that
the evaporator could increase the concentration by at least forty per cent.
foam entrainment in the exhaust gas was noted, but it will not prevent use of
the system. Additional tests are planned for the week of April 2, and use of

some of the concentrate on the feed end of No. 4 Dryer during that week is anti-
cipated.
