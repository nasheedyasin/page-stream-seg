Mr. QO. Parker McComas,

Chairman, Tobacco Industry Research Committee,
5400 Empire State Building,

New York 1, New York,

Dear Mr. McComas:

You will remember that Doster Wilson mentioned
Doctor Sewall Wright of Chicago as probably the outstanding
statistician with biclogical training that there is in thia
countrye JI should like to get your reection informally and
without fixed commitment to the idea thet Doctor Wright might
be approached with the proposition that he might become
Consultant to the Committee on part time at a remuneration of
something in the neighborhood of from five to seven thousand
dollars per annum, with reasonable travel expenses incurred
in the line of duty.

Doctor Wilson felt that there might be a
possibility that if we could move fairly rapidly, VYoctor
hright might be interested, I imagine that he is recei. ving
plenty of offers to take effect on his retirement which comes
soon. I should be glad to have him in residence in Bar Harbor
if he accepted some such proposition and I should count very
heavily on his profound knowledge and wisdom- not only in
statistics, but in general overall planning,

With bert regards, I an

Sincerely yours,

-

Dr. C. C. Little.
