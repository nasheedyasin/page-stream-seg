Dear Mr. Bornstein:

I hope you have found the information which I sent to you on
May 11, 1984, useful

In that letter, I mentioned meeting to discuss the results of
the pilot study Dr. Gori is performing in Franc Unfortunately,
the study has been delayed. I've enclosed a copy of Dr. Gori's
letter for your reference. When the pilot study and analysis has
been completed, we look forward ta discussing the results, as well
as the other points you raised. ~

Given the delays, I would like to suggest meeting at a
convenient time around mid-July. I look forward to your response.

Respectfully,

G. E. Stungis
