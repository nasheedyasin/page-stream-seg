Dear Mr. Frankel:

Unfortunately, your March 27 news report on a study by
California researchers who claim to have found that environ-
mental tobacco smoke is harmful'to the health of nonsmokers,
overlooked the caveats raised by Dr. Claude Lenfant of the
National Institutes of Heaith, whose editorial -- which your
story otherwise quoted extensively -- accompanied the study
in the New England Journal of Medicine. The same was true
of your April 2 editorial, "Thy Neighbor's Lungs." ~

Dr. Lenfant wrote: "Generally speaking, the evidence that
passive smoking in a general environment has health effects
remains sparse, incomplete and sometimes unconvincing." He
went on to point out that “there is no proof as yet that the
reported reduction in airways function has any physiological”
er clinical consequences. The study is confined to only one
as t of an issue too complex to be resolved on such a
limited basis."

The conclusions reached by Drs. White and Froeb also are at odds

- with the latest judgment of the U. S. Surgeon. General. His 1979
Report on Smoking and Health, which addressed this issue, found:
"Healthy nonsmokers exposed to cigarette smoke have little or no
physiologic response to the smoke, and what response does occur
may be due to psychological factors."

Clearly, the California study, which will now be subject to
objective and critical review within the scientific community,
should not be considered the "final word:" For the Times to
advocate public policy which would dictate social behavior and
discriminate against over a third of the adult population on the
basis of this study, seems highly premature and totally out-of-
character.

Sincerely,

unr | on
William D. Toohey( Jr.
