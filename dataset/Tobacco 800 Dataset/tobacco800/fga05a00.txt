Philip Morris USA
Mariboro 100’s Soft
Claimant: Mrs. Albert Sendlenski
Loss Date: 2/22/91

Dear Sir:

This confirms my telephoned assignment of this claim to your office for
response. Mrs. Sendlenski phoned our Richmond plant on February 25,
1991, alleging that the cigarette she had been smoking “popped,"
eausing the coal to drop off onto the bed on which she was sitting.
Glaimant alleges that damage occurred to two down pillows and the
headboard.

Please take the necessary actions to protect our interests in
accordance with the terms and conditions of our products liability
insurance policy. Your settlement authority for this claim is $500.00.

I’ve enclosed a plastic container to be used if you are able to obtain
cigarettes from the claimant. Please mail them to our Richmond office
at the following address: Mr. David Curle, Philip Morris USA,
Operations Center, Quality Assurance Dept., 2001 Bells Road, Gate S,
Door 100, Richmond, Virginia 23234.

Keep me informed as your investigation progresses and let me know the
final disposition of this matter.

Very truly yours,
PHILIP MORRIS MANAGEMENT CORP.
