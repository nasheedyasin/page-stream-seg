Subject: Comments on publications regarding “rewarding effect”
of nicotine etc.

Dear Dr. Carchman,

Attached please find the following:

1. Comments on a Nature article reporting the role of B2 subunits of acethylchotine
receptors in mediating dopamine release in the midbrain of mice by nicotine.

2. Transcript from BBC World Service Radio regarding the article above.

3. Comments on a Nature article reporting “a cellular basis for reports that the first
cigarette of the day is the most pleasurable”.

Please forward this information to Drs. Ellis and Gullotta and appropriate colleagues.

Note on “2.":

« Dr. Changeux is the last author of the article by Picciotto et al.

e Dr. Changeux describes “positive action of nicotine’, namely, as a cognition enhancer
as well as an anxiolytic (page 3; there are obvious mistakes in the transcript such as
describing an anxiolytic to “increase” anxiety). Since B2‘lacking mutant mice show
higher ability of tearning than the wild-type (see “1.” attached), it can be argued that
the subunit functions as an “inhibitor” of learning. In this case the ability of nicotine to
facilitate learning cannot be explained.

« Or. Changeux appears to think that there are several lavels of “addiction” (page 4).

Bast regards,

fw

Kohji Takada
