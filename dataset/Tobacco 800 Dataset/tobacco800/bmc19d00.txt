Mr. J. C. wpjeer:

Dates during which we were not using any glycerine
or a diminished quantity in the Manufacture of Camel cigarettes:

<4 Glycerine

Period on finished cigarettes

January 1, 1943, to March 4, 1943
March 5, 1943, to March 28, 1943
March 29, 1943, to May 18, 1943 ------------- --
May 19, 1943, to October 7, 1943 |
(fate Hhyemne
During the above periods we used for hygroscopic

agent the following materials: diethylene glycol, propylene
glycol, malt syrup and humectose. None of these materials con-

tain; glycerine.

I believe our Sales Department would know more
accurately as to the dates when such cigarettes were on the

market.
