Re: Verification of Claim in Virginia Slims Trade Ad

Dear Nr. Grace:

Assuming that a major brand is one of the top twenty selling brands and
growth is based on percent volume change, then Virginia Slims is indeed
the fastest selling major brand in 1980.

Attached is a list of the top twenty brands in 1980 based on volume which
Support my conclusion.

If you need any additional information, please call.

Sincerely,
C2
