Re: Report No. 20.1954 "Investigation into The Nechanism By Which
Cigarette Paper Fillers and Additives teduce Visible Sidestream ~
Part LI: Decomposition Properties of the Filler"

Dear Mr. McCormack:

1 read your report with great interest and can appree.

of experimental effort involved. As you may know, we have

plagued by an off-taste from cigerettes m Ach

Paper which contai : : ince you have tee
successful using fillers other Me(OH)2 to produce a paper whi
reduces tPM equivalent to Velvet, this offers an opportunity to
determine whether the off-taste is specific to the Mg(OH)y filler or
whether it is a result of the sidestream reducing mechanism.

If it is possible, could you provide us with some samples of paper
which reduce SS-TPM similarly to Velvet (v 50%), but which do not
contain magnesium compounds. This would allow us to hand roll a few
samples to compare with Velvet. One or two 45 cm strips of each
sample would be sufficient. Once the cigarettes were tested, we would
be happy to share the results.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
