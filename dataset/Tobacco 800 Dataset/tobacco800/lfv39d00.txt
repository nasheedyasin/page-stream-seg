Mr, J. C. Whitaker: _ Bo Bk

Referring to Mr. Haberkernts note of August 5 regarding
current prices of Corn and Cane Sugars, according to our calculations,
Cane Sugar will cost us less to use than Corn Sugar on cigarette to--~-
bacco. Approximately 100 lbs. of Corn Sugar are required to replace

75 lbs. of Cane Sugar in cigarette tobacco with equal quality results.

Comparison of cost:

100 lbs. Corn Sugar at $6.63 cwt.
75 lbs. Cane Sugar at 7-50 owt.

Difference in cost

Since we are using 300,000 lbs. Corn Sugar per month on
cigarettes, a saving of $3,000 per month oan be realized by changing
to Cane Sugar.

. On smoking tobacco, which is sold by weight, Corn Sugar
apparently is Gheaper to use. Corn Sugar contains 174 moisture and
Cane Sugar contains 14%. . a |
100 lbs. Corn Sugar = 83 lbs. ary weight at cost of $6.63 / .
75 lbs. Cane Sugar =_]4 lbs. dry weight at cost of _ 5.63

Difference 9 lbs. gain at cost of 1.00

9 lbs. dry weight is equivalent to 104 lbs. weight at 14% °
moisture content (which is P.A. moisture value). Therefore, 10% lbs.
at cost of 1.00 dollar amounts to 94¢ per lb. and will be sold at
price of P.A. which, at 80¢ per 1b., will amount to a gain of
104 x (80-94) or $7.50 for every 100 lbs. of.Corn Sugar used in P.A.
Since we use approximately 200,000 lbs. Corn:Sugar per month in P.A.,
total savings by using Corn Sugar amounts to $15,000 per month.

We are using approximately 500,000 lbs. Corn Sugar per
month in all brands. If we substitute Cane Sugar for all of the
Corn Sugar used in cigarettes, only 200,000 lbs. Corn Sugar will be
required per month in other brands. We have 1,050,000 lbs. Corn Sugar
on hand or 5 months based on this use. However, we think it would
be better to replace only 50% of the Corn Sugar in cigarettes at this
time and later make a further reduction since it is our policy to~
make changes gradually. Also, if later on price controls are taken off -
of Cane Sugar, we may find that Corn Sugar would be cheaper to use.'
By reducing Corn Sugar only 50% in cigarettes at this time, then V
350,000 lbs. of Corn Sugar will be required per month.
