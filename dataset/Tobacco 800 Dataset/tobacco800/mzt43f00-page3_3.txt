b. Attributes. For the total sample, do a 2-way analysis
of variance for each attribute in which cigarettes
(A vs. B) and attribute type {descriptive vs. evaluative)
are treated as the independent variable. Here we would
not be interested in significant main effects, per se,
put rather in significant interactions. Also, do a
series of “F" tests on each product for each attribute
in which the variance associated with descriptive
attributes is compared to that associated with
evaluative attributes. and finally, within each
presentation type, do a 2-way analysis of variance for
each attribute in which cigarettes and replications
are treated as the independent variables,

The analyses described here are the ones that we definitely need,
We also, however, want you to perform any additional analyses
necessary for you to meaningfully interpret the findings.

We want to be provided with a data tape in which individual's
data are recorded identically, in card image fox.

Fielding Date — Early 1980

Respondents ~ Most often smokers of Winston & Marlboro KS (50/50)

one additional point should be emphasized -- in asking the preference
question, do not intentionally or inadvertently inform the smokers
that "no preference" is an option.

['ll be looking forward to your estimate. Thank you.

cordially,
