G-7 Extract Evaporation

The aeration extract evaporator was operated for three days to permit short
test runs on use of extract in the 25 to 30 per cent solids content range. The
following data was obtained while feeding extract to the wet end sheet on No. 4
Dryer while it was running at 280-285 ft./min. inlet sheet speed.

The 20% extract was normal plant material which can be sprayed at 12 PSI with cn
a 0.093 in. dia. nozzle without appreciable spotting of the G-7 sheet. The other

3 concentrations all spotted the sheets but dried without any tackiness. This oe)
showed that the concentrated extract will be satisfactory if the spotting is oe
corrected. Tests have been started using smaller nozzles and higher pressures _—
to atomize the concentrated extract to a greater degree to improve sheet coverage.
