Dear Mr. Stevens:

Bill Kloepfer asked me to copy you with our letter
to the editorial executives at TIME MAGAZINE in
Fone se to their March 8 story on the Surgeon
General's report.

Although it was pretty well wrapped up when your
letter arrived, I do apologize for not getting it
out earlier. Media activity Surrounding the recent
Congressional hearings on the Warning label and a
desire to spend a bit more time than usual with this
assignment were factors.

Hope you like it. And, more importantly, hope it
Opens some eves at TIME. I'll let you know if there's

any response.
Cordially,
Jr.

William D. Toohey,
