Project Title: WINCHESTER

The WINCHESTER blend change proposed for April 1, 1974, by the Leaf
Development Department has been evaluated under test L~7068. These evaluations
involved physical and chemical analyses along with a comparison of the smoking
qualities as opposed to the present biend. Both the proposed blend and a control,
along with prototype cigars representing each test, were processed in the 611-2
pilot area. Data collected from all tests are as follows:
