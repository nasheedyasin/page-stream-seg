How should AMERICAN Filters be incorporated into what had
deen conceived as an AMERICAN ‘Eights test?

How many different executiona should be prepared? And
should they rum in succession or rotation? Which
specific shote are available to us? The final “price”
copy lines also need to be discussed.

Learning from prior problems with atock photography, can
we check to see if we might catch flack from either the
slide house or the original photographer for "altering"
the shots by retouching the cigarette onto the photo
subject? ;

Apropos of recent problems with the background on some of
the new MALIBU unite, let's be absolutely certain that
placement of the government mandatories ta carefully
considered and reflected on the final comps.

E) Production cost and timing estimates will also be
required.

You've indicated that you'll review these issues with the appropriate
Agency personnel.

Please get back to us to set up a review of thease fasves.

Sincerely,

Senior Product Manager
