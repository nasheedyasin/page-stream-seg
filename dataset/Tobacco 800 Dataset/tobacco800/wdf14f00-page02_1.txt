Dear Marvi
As I mentioned in our telephone conversation, Dr. I. W. Hughes -has

asked me to review the Montgomery Counly Maryland Public Smoking
Testimony (Bill 26-76, Scull and Gelman).

The author assumes an imput/output tar generation model for the room.
The parameters used in the numerical estimates are approximately
correct. However, the model in reality is describinga "tar potential".

The limiting or dy ates

that there is so much tar a able per cubic meter. The important
issue is the human-smoke inte ton and therefore is the one that
must be addressed before "leaping to co ons", author's
model obviously does nol include this interaction.

Critical points which are not incorporated in the model ar

KL yields tar in ug/m* what is the particle size distribution

associated with Ji? Sidestream smoke tends tac

rapidly thus forming large particles. Taking this point

into consideration leads one to question the meaning of
uation solution,
