PROCEDURE AND RESULTS:

1. Preparation of Green Burley for Tests

Lots of the 1959 crop of KIOX (Ky.), K10X (F.1.), KIM (Ky.), and KTH
(k.1.) burley gredes were ordered up to 20-24 percent moisture content and
steamed at Whiteker Park. A large part of each lot was sent to Fectory No.
64 for the denicotinizing operation in the Proctor & Schwarts dryer. The
remsinder wes dried to 12-14 percent moiature content, sampled, and packed
in hogsheads for storage a8 controls, with a DWC suffix. Al) but 200 pounds
of each of the K10X (Ky.) DNC and K1OX (E.T.) DNC lots were stored at Shed
No. 154. The 200 pounds from each of these lots was used as an inoculant
for som of the moat severely denicotinized tobecco. The quantities and
analyses of the material treated at Whitaker Park are given here.

2. Denicotinizing Treatment

The undried tobacco strips from Whitaker Park were fed continuously
to the Proctor & Sechwarts dryer which was equipped with a 14-ft. wide apron.
There the tobacco was heated in the first section of the dryer and then
subjected to a steam-anmonia atmosphere for denicotinizing. It was then
deammoniated by further steaming before discharge. This was eesantially the
game treatment an described in RDM, 1959, No. 109.
