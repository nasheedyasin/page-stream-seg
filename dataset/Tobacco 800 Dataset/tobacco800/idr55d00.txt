Paragraph one of the August 12, 1971, minutes of the August 6, meeting
of the Filter Process Study Committee, stated that at the conclusion of a
three truckload test of Eastman 4.2/40,000, a memorandum of recommendation
would be submitted to Mr. B. K. Millaway, Jr. ,

As information, the current 5/45,000 tow is running tight after the |
delivery roll. This creates some problems with wrinkled filters. Also, as
anticipated we are getting some decrease in firmess with 4.2/40,000 tow.
However, the firmness of the filters with the 4.2/40,000 tow will be approxi-
mately equivalent to the firmmess of our King Size Cigarette filters.

Attached are summaries of, all analytical test results and smoker's test
results.

~~ .
Because of the satisfactory test results, it is recommended that Eastman
4.2/40,000 be approved as a replacement for Eastman 5/45,000 for any brand using
or authorized to use 5/45,UUU0 Eastman tow as soon as practical.

Test results indicate that the net savings will be equivalent to a 5% tow
weight reduction or approximately $220,000 annually.
