Gentlemen:

On behalf of each of the nine cigarette
manufacturing companies, listed below, I have been
authorized to present for your prompt consideration
@ proposal for an independent, comprehensive. scien-
tific testing and evaluation of the fuel additive
composition for cigarette tobacco called "Chemosol"
to which you have informed us your Corporation owns
the rights upon which you have one or more issued
United States patents or pending United States
patent applications.

The proposal in this letter has been
developed following the visit of the several tobacco
company research scientists to the laboratory of the
High Tor Foundation, Inc., on July 20, 1967.

While it is the position of these companies
that there is no scientifically established relation-
ship between the testing of mice (and in particular
py the subcutaneous injection of condensates in mice),
and smoking and health, or any scientifically demo:
strated significance in the results of animal testing
as related to human smoking, they believe that it
would be useful promptly to develop and carry out a
program for an independent and extensive scientific
testing of the "Chemosol" composition and the process
utilizing it for addition to cigarette tobacco, in-
cluding the replication of the work of Dr. Perry V.
Hudson and his colleagues.
