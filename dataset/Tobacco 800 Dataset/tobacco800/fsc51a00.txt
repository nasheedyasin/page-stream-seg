Dear Bill:

Just a note to record my hope that a presentation can be put
together which is suitable for delivery to our friends in the
Congress.

They all feel a little lonely when making the fight for tobacco.
We very much need to give them some encouragement as well as
some incentive to present the other side of the picture.

Thanks for your help on all these matters.

Cordially,

EP/d1lb
