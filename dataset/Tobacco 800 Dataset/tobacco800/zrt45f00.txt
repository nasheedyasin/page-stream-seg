Dear Dave:

We received a bill for keying from your accounting department and would like to request
a few things:
0 Please attach to each invoice a copy of the monthly report that

details what was keyed. This way we can easily verify how many

pieces were keyed each month.

Our payment terms are usually net 30, not net 10, We would like to
change the terms to net 30 due to the time it takes internally to
process an invoice.

Please give me to call if you would like to discuss,
Thank you.

Sincerel.
