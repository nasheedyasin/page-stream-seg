Dear Joanne:

Thanks for your recent letter regarding rates and closing dates for
1986. It's always a pleasure to hear that there will be no rate
increase.

I see from your rate card that you have a four time frequency discount
of 20 percent per issue. I assume this also applies to those of us
who advertise in four consecutive U.S. editions of The Atlantic

Salmon Journal as well.

As usual, invoices should be submitted to us in both Canadian dollars
and the U.S. dollar equivalent together with a copy of the
publication.

I have let Mr. William Latshaw of The Leo Burnett Company know your
closing dates, and material for the Spring, 1986 issue will be sent to
you to meet your December 30 deadline.

Very truly yours,

4 â€”~
