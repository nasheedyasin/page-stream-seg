Dear Joanne:

Confirming our telephone conversation, Philip Morris is pleased to
renew participation in the following U.S. editions of
The Atlantic Salmon Journal:

Spring 1986
Summer 1986
Fall 1986
Winter 1986

In each edition, we will place a four-color, full-page bleed Marlboro
advertisement.

I would appreciate it if you would forward your 1986 rate card to me
as soon as possible so that I can finalize the schedule and advise Leo
Burnett Company of closing dates.

In the meantime, I will do everything possible to expedite payment for
our insertion in the 1985 Summer Edition. I'm not sure where the hold
up is, but I promise I'll track it down.

It was a pleasure speaking with you again.

Sincerely yours,
{
