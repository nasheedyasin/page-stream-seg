Dear Tom,

Enclosed are two copies of a proposed licensing agreement between Lorillard
and Harley-Davidson. There are a few blanks which need to be filled in
based on information we need from you. Other than that I think this document
represents a fair account of the agreement we have agreed to verbally.

As Al Peterson may have mentioned to you, I am planning to be in New York
on Tuesday and Wednesday, January 7 and 8, and we have plans to meet for
lunch at 12 noon on January 7. If any questions come up during your early
review of this agreement, perhaps I could answer them at that time.

Looking forward to seeing you.

Very truly yours,

Jeffrey L. Bleustein
Vice President ~ Parts and Accessories
