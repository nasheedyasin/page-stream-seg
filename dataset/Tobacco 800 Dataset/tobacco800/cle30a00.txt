Dear Lorraine

Back in Winnipeg after a short holiday in Puerto Rico, its time to gather
my thoughts and clear my desk. The meeting at the Dorado Beach Hotel was
very good and we certainly appreciated the opportunity to visit an off-
shore island. My expenses associated with the trip are small; one requires
explanation and it may not be allowable. The plane from Minneapolis left
for San Juan at 07.30; this meant travelling from Winnipeg the previous
evening and taking an hotel near the airport. | have enclosed the bill for
this expenditure.

EXPENSES:
Taxis to and from Winnipeg airport: $ 20

Hotel at Minneapolis: — $117.45

TOTAL - $137.45“

Now | get down to the grant reviews for the April meeting.
