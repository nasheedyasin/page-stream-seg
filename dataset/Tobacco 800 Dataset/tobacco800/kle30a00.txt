Dear Lorraine

| enclose a list of expenses incurred for the April 1994 meeting of the
Scientific Advisory Board. The new arrangements agreed to should, in the
future, make everybodyâ€™s task considerably easier. It was so nice to have

you at the dinner last Thursday evening.

Please convey my thanks to your staff for the superb support they give the
members of the board. It is appreciated.

Sincerely

A,

Drummond H. Bowden
