Dear Jerry,

During my last visit. to Richmond, I told you that we are
interested in building, a kind of “automatic cigarette in-
spection device" which could measure weight, RID, diameter,
firmness, moisture content, etc.. As you know, our analytical
services are inspecting, on a regular basis, PM Europe's and
competitors' cigarettes for all European markets. These rep-
resent more than 250 brands. To dispose of such an apparatus
would be a great time-saver for us and this. apparatus could
also be foreseen for use at QC production.

In the meantime, I was contacted by the firm Diversified Engineer-
ing, Inc. of Richmond which is interested! in developping and build-
“ing a prototype in collaboration with ourselves. I sent a short
description of the planned apparatus (see enclosure) to this firm
and we decided not to start development at FTR until we receive
their quotation. Untill now, I have received no written quota-
tion, but during a phone conversation with the European director
of Diversified Engineering, I learned that the price would be
approx. $60,000. He also asked me if this device could not be
developped in connection with PM USA. As Diversified Engineering
is located in Richmond, this would considerably facilitate matters.

Are you interested in such a device and what do you think about
this proposal ?
