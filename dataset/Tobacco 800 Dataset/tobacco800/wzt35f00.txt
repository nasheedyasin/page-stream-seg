RE: TRIPLE BRAND OFFENSIVE DIRECT MA

TO: THE ENTIRE SALES ORGANIZATION

We're pleased to announce American Tobacco's most aggressive offensive Direct Mail program
to date!

That's right, on January 18, 1994, over $17,000,000 in pack and carton coupons were mailed to
competitive smokers!

All three of our priority brands .. MONTCLAIR, MISTY and CARLTON are receiving targeted
support to capture new competitive smokers. A sample of each Direct Mail piece is attached for
your use in gaining extra impact at retail.

So do your part and maximize in-store presence with P.O.S., Displays and Advance Orders on
MONTCLAIR, MISTY and CARLTON.
