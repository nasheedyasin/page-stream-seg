Moreover, smoking is an adult decision, and all of our
tising and promotions are directed at informed
adult smokers. The bedspread is stated to be for use on

children's beds and it is therefore contrary to our advertising
and promotion policies. ;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we would likely be amenable
to resolving this matter on the following basis:

(a) Your advising us as to the names and addresses of the

manufacturer and any intermediary Suppliers of the
bedspread;

(b) Provide us with the number of bedspreads sold to-date
and as to any remaining stock on hand;

(Cc) Undertake to cease all further sale and distribution of

the bedspread after the exhaustion of your current
stock on hand.

I look forward to hearing from you promptly, in the hopes
that this matter may be amicably resolved.
