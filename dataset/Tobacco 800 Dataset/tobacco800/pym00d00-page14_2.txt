- Clearly summarize BACKGROUND, WORKING HYPOTHESIS and BROAD GOALS of the project. Do not
exceed the space allotted below plus the top half of the next page.

The cellular-yes and cellular-sre genes are homologues of their
oncogenic forms found in the genomes of avian sarcoma viruses.
They encode proteins of approximately 60 kilodalton molecular mass
which are myristylated, associated with membranes, and active as
protein-tyrosine kinases. Physiological functions of these proteins
are not known,

It has been proposed that the amino terminal portions of
non-receptor type tyrosine kinases have a regulatory role because
mutations in that region can influence the enzymatic activity of
these proteins. It is also assumed that the amino terminal domains
of tyrosine kinases interact with unknown cellular proteins and that
this association modulates their enzymatic activities.

To test these hypotheses and to investigate the normal functions
of the yes and sre proto-oncogenes, we will focus our studies on
the isolation of proteins that interact with or are phosphorylated by
these kinases using anti-idiotypic antibodies, cDNA expression libraries,
and standard biochemical methods.
