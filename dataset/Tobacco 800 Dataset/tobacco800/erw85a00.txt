Except for the tobacco which had already been redried at Nanville,
the numbers of bactersa, yeasts and molds were reduced to levels typical
of other redried tobaccos-

The sugar content of this tobacco was Jow ranging from about 1.5 to
1.75% because of the method of curing. This renders the tobacco less
suspectible to severe microbial damage during storage.

Ry redrying to about 12% modature and storing in a place such as
Davie County where little or no spoilage has occurred, the VSKW leaf
shovld age without spoilage.
