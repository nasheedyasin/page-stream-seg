This is to confirm the B&W agreement for you to obtain B&W produced
KENT cut tobacco from the Singapore Tobacco Company should you deem it
appropriate.

I will advise you as to the Macon factory standards for residual casing
weight on LUCKY STRIKE tobacco as soon as I receive this information.

With kind regards,
