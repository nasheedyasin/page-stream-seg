decisions of this Committee: -

1. To gradually increase the quantity of glycerine
in cigarette and smoking tobacco formulas to
that of pre-wer Tormulas.~
To continue the use of propylene glycol for its
anti-mold value in addition to its value as a
softening agent for tobacco,

To discontinue Humectose, ~

To treat plug tobacco so that it will keep in
pliable condition,

Glycerine and Propylene Glycol estimated use ~
