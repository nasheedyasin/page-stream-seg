Re: Grant No. 4369R1
Dear George:

It was nice to talk to you on the phone and I thank you for the information and advice. You had
mentioned to me that CTR regulations allow a $10,000 rollover within three months of the end of a
fiscal year.

I would like permission to rebudget $22,750 from the year that expired on December 31, 1997
(i.e., before the 3 months are over) to purchase an Eppendorf Micromanipulation System. This will
obviate the necessity of a rollover.

Thave attached for your information a justification for the equipment.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,

’
