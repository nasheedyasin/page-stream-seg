At the request of Mr. Alejandro Arteta, Fabrica de Cigarrillos, El Progreso
S.A.; Mr. W. A. Goodson, Winston Leaf submitted three types of flue-cured
tobaccos for quality evaluation, by Tobacco Development.

It was our understanding they were to be investigated as supplements for
the AO-1 Argentine flue-cured blend presently utilized in their King, Commander,
and possibly the mild charcoal filter blends. Based on this assumption they
were smoked individually against the Argentine flue-cured by the International
Expert Panel. In their opinion grade AFD-SFD (R.J.R.-3) was equivalent to
AO-1 in flavor and aroma while AF4S (R.J.R.-3) had similar characteristics, but.
less overall flavor. However, they felt both could be utilized as supplements
to AO-1 but not as a total replacement. The JDS (R.J.R.-6) was rejected com-
pletely due to the low flue-cured flavor and arema.

The R.J.R. grades were assigned by Mr. John Hutcheson and the only reason
JDS was graded 6 was based on color and texture. Further evaluations were
carried out by Mr. Hutcheson under TL-452.
