Dear Dr. Volpon:
Reference: Flavor for World-Wide BEST Project
I am sending two components of a flavor BBC-889 that we find very

encouraging. These components are BBC-884 and BBC-900 and the flavor
BBC-889 is made up as follows:

Per 10 ml

BBC-900 0.605 gm
BBC- 884 1.0 ml
GOLIC Q.S.

10 pl of this flavor when injected into a cigarette having a tobacco
weight of 760 mg gives the appropriate level of flavor. I will discuss
these flavors at the forthcoming flavoristsâ€™ seminar in Germany.

Under separate cover, I am also sending a pack of our blank injected
with this flavor for your comments. The purpose of sending the flavors
is for you to incorporate your experience into these flavors to make up
any deficiency that you might perceive in our product when smoked
against Marlboro. You already have our blanks (327562) to work with.

If you find something promising, I would certainly like to evaluate it
here.

Roop
