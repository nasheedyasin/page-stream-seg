Dear Tom,

4
Attached is a copy of a proposed letter agreement with Brown & Williamson.
This letter was worked out in a series of telephone conversations with B&W
following their receipt of my letter of March 31, 1986.

In my opinion this is an acceptable compromise and I am prepared to sign

it if it is acceptable to you. If it is, I would also modify the reference
to the March 31] letter in our Agreement and substitute a signed copy of

the May I, 1986 letter.

Very truly yours,

Jeffrey L. Bleustein
Vice President - Parts and Accessories
