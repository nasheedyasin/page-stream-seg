SUBJECT _ GC-MS ANALYSIS OF FIRMENICH MUSK PREPARATION ASCE

The Firmenich Exaltolide sample from you has been analyzed by fused
silica capillary GC/mass spectrometry in both electron impact and
chemical ionization modes. Figure 1 shows the reconstructed total
ion chromatogram.

The major Peak D was positively identified as oxacyclohexadecan-2-one
(or cyclopentadecanolide, C,, H. 0.) with e molecular weight of 240.
The minor Peak E has a moleCilaf weight of 220 and is not oxacyclohexaâ€”
decan-2-one or its isomers. Peaks A, B, and C were judged as minor
impurities although positive identifications could not be made due to
poor signal-to-noise ratios.

The following table gives the percentage of each peak based on separate
GC analyses using a Flame ionization detector.
