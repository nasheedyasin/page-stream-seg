Dear Doctor Gardner: ,;

Iam most pleased that you have asked me to serve as an ad hoe consultant to the Scientific
Advisory Board of the Council for Tobacco Research - U,S.A., Inc. 1am also prepared to
give an informal talk to the Scientific Advisory Board on March 14, I should like to present
the results and interpretations of work that has recently been done, and is being done, in
my laboratory, rather than to talk on the subjects you have mentioned in your letter, My
laboratory has been occupied with a tumor model as it progresses and regresses in two

inbred strains of rats and we are looking at the immunologic phenomena that are associated
with these states, I hope that this subject will be acceptable to you since it is one that I
am most familar with and can speak with some authority of experience.

I look forward to seeing you then on the 14th of March in Phoenix, Arizona. I would be
interested to learn what day, or days, will be needed for the peer review of applications
that have been submitted, ,
Sincerely yours,

Seer f D LelLarw CC
