Dear Mr, Nicholls:

I am writing in response to your letter of May 14, 1973, concerning
ethylene oxide and propylene oxide treatment of tobacco.

Our current interest is in the use of propylene oxide as a meana of
lowering nicotine content of tobacco, More specifically {n response
to your request, our chemista have found no halohydring in tobacco or
smoke of treated tobaccos. Details of these findings will be forth-
coming in raport form,

Several years ago we experimented with ethylene oxide as a tobacco
eterilant. Ethylene oxide treatment of leaf under pressure generally
caused s reduction in bacterial and yeast populations, A variety of
pure culture bacteria ware reduced to a non-viable state by ethylene
oxide, There was no massurable effect on alkaloids of flua-cured
tobacco but a slight reduction did occur when burley tobacco was treated
with ethylene oxide, Upon room storage for approximately 30 days the
alkaloida in thia burley tobacco returned to the original amounts,

I am enclosing several related reprints which you may find of benefit.
There is also equipment available from U. 5S. Manufacturers for gaseous
Sterilization work.

Sincerely,

Ct Gant,
