TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE SALES ORGANIZATION WHO OPERATE
IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND

The State of Maryland has passed a regulation, effective June l,
1975, increasing the tax on cigarettes from 6 cents to 10 cents per
package of 20 cigarettes.

This measure requires wholesale and retail dealers to take an in-
ventory of all cigarettes on the effective date. Therefore, at the
close of business on May 30, you are to take a complete inventory

of all packages of 20s in your possession bearing Maryland state tax
stamps. This inventory must be in this office before June 5 so we
May remit the tax due to the state.

If your territory includes another state in addition to Maryland and
you are working in that state on May 30, you should not, of course,
have any Maryland taxed merchandise on hand. However, you should
inform us by letter to this effect.

The quantity of 20s reported on your inventory should be multiplied
by 4 cents and this amount should be deducted from your Expense
Account. Our Tax Department will remit the same amount to the
State of Maryland.

Beginning on the effective date, you are to sell all merchandise in
your possession at the new increased prices.

Please retain this letter as proof of the fact that the new tax rate
has been complied with in the event you are questioned by an agent
of the State Tax Commission.

Sales Department
