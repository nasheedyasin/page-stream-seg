Dear Mr. Hoyts

- I am enclosing a copy of a letter from Stanley Salmen, of Little,
Brown & Cow, and a copy of my reply. Little, Brewn & Co. is at the moment
considering a manuscript of mine on the inheritance of coat color in dogs.
Â« Scott is the head of our division on behavior studies at the Jackson
Laboratory.

You will note that in Mr. Salmen's first paragraph he lit the fuse
that set off my reply to him, I wanted you and Mr. McComas to kmow of this
personal reaction of mine. I felt that it was better to keep the matter on
a personal basis, unless and until it becomes more mature. At that time, if
possible, I think we should obtain judgment from the Advisory Board. I hope
that my reaction will stall or slow down Mr, Salmen's activities.

Sincerely yours,

CCK ick.
