On June 29, 1992, you provided Brown & Williamson a listing to indicate
which brands of B&W owned trademarks were being produced by BAT cyprus
with non-caution labels. I would again appreciate your assistance in
regards to one clarification,

Dees BAT Cyprus manufacture LUGKY STRIKE KS Box with non-caution labels
for any market? If so, what are the markets?

Your prompt reply to this inquixy will be most appreciated,

With kind regards,

Marcel A. Hamann
