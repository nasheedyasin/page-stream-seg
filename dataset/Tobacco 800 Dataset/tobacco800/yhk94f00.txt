Dear Mr. Tannenbaum:
Re: Chemosol

On April 3, 1968, I promptly circulated your
letter of April 1st to representatives of each of the
Companies for whom I was authorized to write the offer
of August 1, 1967.

I have now heard from enough of these Companies,
stating their view that the “most favored nation" pro-
vision in the August 1, 1967 letter is deemed essential,
to require me, however regrettably, to tell you that the
eounter proposal in your letter of April 1, 1968, will
not be acceptable.

Perhaps you will be interested tn a quotation
from one of these replies which observes:

“From the point of view which I rep-
resent as counsel to a company which

a small factor in the cigarette
field, it is absolutely essential
that the terms upon which the invention
might be licensed by our client must be
no more onerous than the terms granted
to any competitor A 'most favored
nation’ clause is essential."

As the matter now stands, I hope it will be
possible for you to talk with Mr. Beck to the end that
we may get agreement on the original proposal and the
additional data relating to Appendix IX which I re-
quested in my letter of March 5, 1968.

With best regards.
Sincerely yours,
