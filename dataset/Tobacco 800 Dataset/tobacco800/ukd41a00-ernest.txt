Commissioa's plan to release it on the dasis that “all of your
econpany's sigatficant ceapatitors ia the cigarette buginess
have 7, Americana Tobacco Connany 19 a substantial competitor
and unicss the YfC hes already given the report ta American it
doas not possess it. . .

The Roper Study wis privately funded sud unidertaken for a private
business function. Your release will benefit our conpetitora who
de not have it and wil benefit other business adversaries of
Drown & Williamson. We protest your Telease of a study obtained
under compulsory process in a non-public investigation.

Barrington Parker relating to the Roper Study and related issues
of confidentiality asd you are hereby inforned that if you
release the Roper Study before wa have had an opportunity for a
hearing on this aatter we will press for appropriate judicial
sanction.

These is no urgency in diaclosing the Roper Study or information
