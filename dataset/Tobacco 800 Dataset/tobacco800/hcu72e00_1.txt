Infringement of MARLBORO and MARLBORO Roof Design

Re:
Trademarks on Sega SUPER MONACO GP Video Arcade Game

Dear Mr. Foster:

Further to our telephone conversation of January 17, 1990, I
have now received both the original of your letter of January 11,
1990, sent by federal express and the facsimile thereof.

I confirm that this matter can be settled on the basis of
our discussions to-date and assuming that Sega takes the
following steps that we have discussed and either agreed upon,
but I feel warrant further Clarification, or were remaining open
issues:

1. Elimination of all MARLBORO (word) trademarks, or any
portion thereof and elimination of all Red Roof Designs
(with or without MARLBORO) appearing in the video
graphics of the subject game including, but not limited
to those appearing in the photograph enclosed with your
letter;

A decal at the apex or other modification of the red

banner across the "hood" of the cabinet so as to
obscure the Red Roof which the red banners form;
