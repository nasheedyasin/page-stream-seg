RE: ar -Davi ' ettes - 8a

Dear Mr. Bluestein:

Enclosed, for your files, find one set of full size and one set of
reduced size reproductions of promotion mechanicals we are producing
in support of Harley-Davidson cigarettes. These are in addition to
those previously submitted and include:

(1) 2-Tier Display with Riser Card and Counter Display with
Riser Card - displays which will be used in conjunction with
a free lighter promotion.

(2) Paper Cube - memo pad which will be used as a “leave behind"
for our salespeople when they make initial sales calls.

I have also enclosed a sample of the lighter we will be using for our
promotion.

Sincerely,
A WE "_
