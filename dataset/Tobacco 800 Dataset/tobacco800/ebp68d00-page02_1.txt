RE: SALEM ULTRA 85mm PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION
SEE ENDALLON

Purpose

Recommend the 85mm product for national introduction based on top-
line product test results.

Background

Four product candidates and Triumph Menthol 85's were blind tested
in NFO. All candidates used a single stage filter with a tar range
of 3.7 to 5.2 mg. The tar level of Triumph was 2.8 mg.

The minimum action standards are:

@Â® Parity versus Triumph Menthol 85mm among SALEM LIGHTS 85mm
smokers.

Parity versus Triumph Menthol 85mm among female fuller flavor
low tar 85mm menthol smokers (excluding SALEM LIGHTS) .

Summary of Topline Results

All four candidates met both action Standards (see Exhibits I and II).

Candidate B (5.2 mg. tar) and Candidate c (4.9 mg. tar) exceeded the
first action standard by achieving superiority versus Triumph among
the SALEM LIGHTS 85mm franchise: Importantly, Candidate C was rated
superior among females and older smokers. Candidate B was rated supe-
rior among young adult smokers, a subgroup of lesser importance.

While all candidates achieved the second action standard of parity
among competitive smokers, only Candidates B and C achieved higher
absolute ratings among total female smokers albeit not a directional
win. Candidate C achieved parity among all subgroups. Candidate B
achieved superiority among younger adult female smokers, but lost to
Triumph among males.

Recommendation
secommendaation

Candidate C, the 4.9 mg. product, is recommended for national intro-
duction based on confirmation of final product test results.
