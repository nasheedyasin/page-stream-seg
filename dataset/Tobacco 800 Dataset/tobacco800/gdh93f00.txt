Dear Dr. Volpon:
Subject: Modified CLD Samples

As agreed, we are sending you modified CLD samples for your evaluation.
The purpose of this exercise was to examine the effect of applying
licorice at different sites before or after CLD, The sample
descriptions are as follows:

427616 - Control. Licorice applied to burley prior to CLD.

327618 - No licorice on burley prior to CLD and instead all the
sveorice applied to the blend of cased leaf dried burley,
paper and band cast recon as top dressing.

327620 - No Licorice on burley prior to GLD. All the licorice
spread across total lamina and recon blend.

327617 Same as 327616 except 4 different flavor.

327619 Same, as 327618 except a different flavor which is same as
in 327617.

If possible, we would like to discuss your evaluations in the

foreheoming Flavorist's Seminar. Similar samples have been sent to
Germany.

Best regards,
