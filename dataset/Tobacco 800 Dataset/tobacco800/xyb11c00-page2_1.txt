Dear Geri:

This will confirm our conversation of May 1984 outlining the
modifications in the continuing mail survey questionnaire.

Most of the changes concern brands lists, slogans and situations;
and for each of these, a list has been addended to this letter.
Marketing Research and Media Departments were involved in compiling
these lists; however, they are in no particular order, so if you

or Henry feel that further randomization is warranted, please do so.

Other changes in the questionnaire have been discussed by Systems
and Marketing Research. They are:

1. Demographics

. Please be sure that the categories within each demographic
question are the same ranges (and punch codes) as the
telephone survey questionnaire. This will facilitate

. combination/comparison of the two studies.

2. Respondent Instructions

For questions 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 the second sentence in the
respondent instructions could be confusing. Perhaps what

is meant is: '"... in the row for each brand," or "... in one
of the columns next to each brand." This is especially
noteworthy when one notices that generally “the column next

to each ..." is the negative response.

3. Negative, Neutral, Positive Order

In all of the questions mentioned above except number 8, the
order in which the response columns appear is negative, neutral,
positive. Question 8, however, reverses that order both in
layout and punch code. This can be confusing when working
