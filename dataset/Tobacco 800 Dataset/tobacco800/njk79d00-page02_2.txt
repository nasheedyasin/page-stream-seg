1. Continued:

- Net switching indicates superior performance among males
and young adult smokers (18-34). See Fxhibit IT.

Slight male skew increase is consistent with current
franchise profile. See Fxhibit III.

Target segment and switching profile weighted 70% to re-
flect importance of males and younger adults. See Exhibit
Tit.

100's prime prospect remains unchanged to acknowledge impor-
tance of the older, female smoker in our current franchise.

- Reflecting switching performance would overstate the im-
portance of males and young adults beyond that already
reflected in target segment profile. Overemphasis would
result in media delivery away from our source of business.

Target segment and current franchise continue to be
weighted equally. See Exhibit Iv.

Weighting of King's and 100's for combined prime prospect
profile is unchanged.

- Weighting of King's (67%)/100's (33%) is proportional to
volume.

Results in greater effectiveness of media plan delivery.

- 52% of impressions now delivered to target audience.

Summary

Revised prime prospect profile retains Brand's defensive posture
while recognizing an offensive opportunity against males and
young adults. This results in increasing the effectiveness of the
media plan.

Next Steps

Approval of the refined prime prospect definition is requested so
1980 media plans can be revised as soon as possible,
