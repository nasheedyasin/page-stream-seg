August 4, 1947

Mr. J. C. Whitaker, Chn.
Formula Committee.

The Formula Committee at its meeting on June 12, 1947,
directed us to increase the quantity of glycerine in cigarette
and smoking tobacco formulas. Also, to add a hygroscopic agent
to plug tobacco so that it will keep in a nore pliable condition.
It is our understanding the amount of glycerine in these formulas ©
should be increased gradually, the first increase to become ef-
fective the early part of August when our stock of Humectose will
be used up. Since Humectose contains approximately 70% sugar, it
is desirable to add cane suger to the formulas in which Humectose
is taken out. Therefore, we propose the following changes in our
formulas to become effective as soon as our present stock of Humec-
tose is exhausted, which will be in the next few days:/

Cigarettes: Increase glycerine from 14% to. 2%.
Increase raw sugar from 100# to 125#.

» Pe Ae Increase glycerine from 20# to 504. . /
‘ - Inerease raw sugar from 125# to 150#.

. f AIA,
G. We Increase .glycerine from 0# to 204.7 tgs
Add 5% glycerine. ~~
