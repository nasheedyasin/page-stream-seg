Dear Lorraine,
It was good to see you again at the April SAB meeting. I enclose my expense
account in relation to this meeting together with a letter for Dr. Glenn, if you

- would be kind enough to pass this on to him.

Before any of us knows it, September will be here once more and we shall be
gathered together again!

With many thanks for your kindness and your assistance.

Yours sincerely,

A
