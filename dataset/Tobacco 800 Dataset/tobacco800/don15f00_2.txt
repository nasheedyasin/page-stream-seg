The attached memorandum represents the result of over a year's
consideration of the apparent contradiction existing between the recorded

relatively static incidence rate of oral cavity cancer and the increased
per capita use of tobacco.

The study of cancer of the oral cavity offers what appears to

be an excellent field for increasing our knowledge in the broad area of
Tobacco use and Health.

I am therefore distributing this memorandum to the members of the
Executive Committee for reference as the development of its recommended
program evolves.
