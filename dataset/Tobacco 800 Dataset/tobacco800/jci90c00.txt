TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE SALES ORGANIZATION WHO OPERATE
IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND

The State of Rhode Island has passed a regulation, effective Jun
1975, increasing the tax on cigarettes from 13 cents to 18 cents
per package of 20 cigarettes.

This measure requires wholesale and retail dealers to take an
inventory of all cigarettes on the effective date. Therefore,
at the close of business on May 30, you are to take a complete
inventory of all packages of 20s in your possession bearing

Rhode Island state tax stamps. This inventory must be mailed
to this office May 30. On June 2, we must remit the tax due

to the State of Rhode Island.

If your territory includes another state in addition to Rhode
Island and you are working in that state on May 30, you should
not, of course, have any Rhode Island taxed merchandise on hand.
However, you should inform us by letter to this effect.

The quantity of 20s reported on: your inventory should be multi-
plied by 5 cents and this amount should be deducted from your
Expense Account. Our Tax Department will remit the same amount
to the State of Rhode Island.

Beginning on the effective date, you are to sell all merchandise
in your possession at the new increased prices.

Please retain this letter as proof of the fact that the new tax
rate has been complied with in the event you are questioned by
an agent of the State Tax Commission.
