RE: Infringement of MARLBORO and MARLBORO Roof Design

Trademarks on Sega SUPER MONACO GP Video Arcade Game

Dear Mr. Yasuda:

This is further to and will confirm our telephone
conversation of November 15, 1989, wherein I objected to the Sega
SUPER MONACO GP video arcade game, that I noted in the Penn
Station, New York City location of Time Out Family Amusement
Centers.

In particular, the game has the following objectionable,
unauthorized uses of Philip Morris trademarks:

1. Red Roof-like devices on game cabinet;
Roof Device images on video graphics;

MARLBORO word and Roof Devices on banner across race
course on video graphics; and

MARLBORO and Roof Device on grand prix car appearing on

video graphics.
09000!
