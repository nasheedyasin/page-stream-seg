RE: Grant No.3035AR1

Dear Dr. Glenn:

I am very pleased to accept a-renewal of my grant
from The Council for Tobacco Research - USA, Inc. for
the period from July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1996 for
the study proposed in my application entitled “ Functional
Analysis of yes and src Proto-oncogenes”. As before, I] would
like to assure you that there is no overlap between the CIR
application and my other applications submitted to or awarded
by other agencies. ‘

I am sorry to be late in sending you the " Notice
of Research Grant" and "Human Subjects Approval Form".
This is due to an important change; I have taken a position
of Associate Professor at the Department of Biochemistry,
at The Mount Sinai School of Medicine. I will start there
on September 1, 1995, I have informed Dr. Arthur Eisenberg
about this change last week and have sent to him all the
relevant administrative information.

With thanks for support and advice.

Sincerely yours,

M wv
