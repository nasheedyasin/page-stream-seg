Mr. J. C. Whitaker, Chm. ;
Formula Conmittee . aon

Referring to letter of July 16 from Purchasing
Dept. to you regarding price reduction of Peanut Oil, we
recormended in our note of March 21, 1947, that when the
cost of this oil is more reasonable we should increase
the amount used in our formula.

Peanut oil and Marcol (mineral oil) are used
in Apple grease. At present we are using 50% Peanut Oil
and 50% Marcol. We recommend that Peanut Oil be increased
to 66-2/3% and Marcol decreased to 33-1/3%.

Please let us hear from you as to your wishes in
this matter.
