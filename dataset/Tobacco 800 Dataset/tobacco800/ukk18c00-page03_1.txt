(for details cf. meetings notes dated November 4, 1981).
Grimmer experiment

The task force will visit Prof, Grimmer at his laboratory, February
8, 1982,

. IFA meeting in Hamburg, November 14, 1981
a) Discussion with TKR representatives:

~ TKR propagates the addition of urea to tobacco for the reduction

of BaP and nitrosamines.
- They gave a poor performance and their intentions appeared rather

questionable.

b) Dr. Scherer suggested to do chemical and biochemical investigations
with cigarettes that have differing nicotine and nitrate levels
in order to invalidate upcoming results by Bock. After a very
tedious and time consuming discussion it was decided that
Dr. Scherer should prepare two alternative research protocols early
next year.

A draft copy of the manuscript for the first publication on nitros-
amines (nitrosamine levels in public places) was handed out to
the participants. RJR gave input in the meantime.

The VdC had been informed by Prof. Korte that he would not include
the paper by Scherer/Barkemeyer in his upcoming EC report, perhaps
in the first update (scheduled for Feb. 82) since their paper

"did not add to existing knowledge".

For further details cf. meeting notes dated November 12, 1981.
