Dear Ms. Ludovici:

Your letter to Mr. Robert Mikulay regarding advertising in THE HORSEPLAYER
MAGAZINE has been forwarded to my attention.

After careful review, we have concluded that THE HORSEPLAYER MAGAZINE
does not meet the marketing objectives of our brands at this time.

We will retain your media kit in our files for future reference and will contact you if
ne

Many thanks for your proposal, and best of luck in your endeavors.

Sincerely,

cc: R. Mikulay
