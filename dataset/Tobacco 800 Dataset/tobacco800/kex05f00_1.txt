Dear Mr. Costello:

Attached is the 1978 newspaper budget report which has
been revised to include both Milwaukee and Minneapolis/
St. Paul.

The total expenditure for the First Quarter Minneapolis/
St. Paul activity was $22,000, The Milwaukee activity
is also estimated to cost $22,000. Since there was a
rate increase in April, we do not anticipate another
increase before the end of ovr schedule in August.

Therefore, we are releasing the $6,000 contingency,
reducing the total newspaper budget from $50,000 to
$44,000.

Cordially,

Ja Schan
Media Planner
