Mr. C. FE. Orandey -2-« February 5, 1958

It is anticipated that film processing will also be affected to a
great degree during this month, but I can assure you that we will
make every possible effort to complete these commercials on a
crash basis. We hone to have our new films on the air by the end
of February but, in view of the vossible obstructions outlined .
above, I’ cannot guarantee that our current filmed’ spots will be
off the air before the second week in March, ee

All changes discussed! with you yesterday have been passed along to
the advertising agency and the wrk described: to you has already:
been initiated. Since the only appreciable time required for a
change in any of these media lies in the area of our television
spots, I hope you will find this program satisfactory.

Our thanks for taking the time and trouble to meet with us yester~
day - your advice and explanations, I am sure, will be most
helpful to us.

Sincerely yours,
