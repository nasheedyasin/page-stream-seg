Dear Mr. Gilmovsky:

Your letter to Mr. George Weissman of
November 9 has been forwarded to this
office.

We would certainly be interested in dis-
cussing your proposal on advertising to
ethnic groups. In this connection, I
suggest you contact Mr. James Thompson,
Media Manager and Mr. Clifford Wilmot,
Director of Brand Management for Philip
Morris U.S.A. These are the gentlemen
who can best serve as your contacts with
our company.

Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,
Row - Landry S
