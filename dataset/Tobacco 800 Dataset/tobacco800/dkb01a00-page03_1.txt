Dear Dr. Tso:

We have received your letter of Septerber 30, 1964, concerning
"Pederal-State health oriented research programs on tobacco". In
particular you raise the question as to whet chemical components in
tobacco’ "sre considered to be potentially health hazardous and should
be studied”,

Tam sure you realize, particularly after the Lexington
Kentucky conference, that in the present state of knowledge it is really
impossible to compile any such List of "potentially hazardous c 3"
of tabacco, The reason, of course, is that the presumed danger
cigarette smoking are conjectural in nature, bi nferred largely from
statistical relationships by methods that are still under question and
challenge by many of our 1 i tatist s. There is no di
whose relationship to cigarette smoking as a significant causal or
contributory factor has been convincingly demonstrated by clinical or
experimental methods. Still less has any contributory mechanism been
traced out in detail or shown to be due to.any specific ingredient of
cigarette smoke. . -

This certainly does not mean that it is impossible to do useful
ce that may eventually

become inportent It must, however, be realized, as someone pointed out
in lexington, thet such studies can only be based upon “Limited working
hypotheses" or "specilative presumptions” that may prove to have no
foundation, As.was said there “opportunities to waste time on futile
leads are enormous", Fortunately the by-products of selentific work so
often become more important than the original goals that good selentific
effort is not likely ta be wasted in the long run, On + clearly
defined basis we would approve competent efforts to accumulate new
knowledge of the components of the tobacco plant as affected by strain
difference, soil components, weather conditions, genetic factors,
fertilizers, insecticides, plant diseases, curing methods, ageing etc.
