acid may be expected to give increasing effect. It does, however,

point up the fact that definite mumerical values can only be assigned
after an extremely large amount of data has been accumulated. These
differences arise because of the large differences between successive
specimens [commonly as much as 100%]. However, it is felt that sufficient
data has now been obtained to confirm the fact that citric acid on
tobacco at the one percent level is sufficient to provide the desired
effect, that is, to neutralize the ciliary inhibiting effect of utreated
tobacco smoke.â€™ '*
