Dear Bernie:

Please provide us with a cost and time estimate for the joint
BAT/BEW Methodology Study that we have discussed on various
eccasions. in this study, 400 non-menthol smokers (evenly split
by sex) are to be tested under each of the eight combinations of
three methodological variables:

1. Presentation type (sequential vs. simultaneous)
2, preference position (before, vs. after)
3. Attribute type (descriptive vs. evaluative)

Attached you will find draft questionnaires and a table illustrating
individual cells. The questionnaixes. are labeled with a 3edigit
cell number where: .

1. The first digit refers to presentation type (Le
sequential, 2 = simultaneous}

2. he second to attribute type (1 = descriptive,
2 = evaluative)

3, The third to.preference position (1 5 before
attributes, 2 = after attributes).

These studies require in~house interviews in which smokers will be
given 5 packs each of two numerically-coded cigarettes that, for
reporting purposes, will be referred to as A and B.

Analyses

You will be required to analyze and interpret the data, keeping
in mind that the purpose of the study is not simply to evaluate
