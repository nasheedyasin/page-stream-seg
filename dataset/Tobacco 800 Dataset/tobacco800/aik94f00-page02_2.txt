hts on the part of that company to negotiate.
It is simply an undertaking that you will accord to
every applying cigarette manufacturer, whether or not
a@ participant in the progra s and conditions as
favorable as those you have previously given or may
nafter give to any other cigarette company. If
during the course of testing program, which I am

ar deal, another company who
o avail itself of the process’
would expect to get the same terms and conditions. In
my view, the pro on would not only promote the wider
use of the process if the claims for it were confirmed
—- by that independent evaluation and in this sense would
in no way be a restraint upon your negotiations.

In addition, in our meeting on February 23rd,
Mr. Beck undertock to canvass with Dr. Hudson the re-
quest made for the data supporting Appendix IX in his
_ latest Blue Book and the ambiguities concerning the
suggestion that Dr. Hudson or one of his representatives

"be present at all times to see that everything is done
_ properly." I assume that neither you nor he has had an
opportunity as yet to clarify that point.

with my desire to move this project

along, I communi d the discussio: on February 23rd
to each of the participants. I am hopeful that you can

_ reconsider your position on paragraph 4 of the letter
of August 1, 1967, or amplify your objections to it
possibly leading to clarification of the provision if
that seems necessary. Just as soon as I hear from you
about clarification of the point about Appendix IX and
the insistence in Mr. Beck's letter of January 15, 1968
that Dr. Hudson be c antly present during the in-
dependent evaluation, I will promptly send these mate-
rials to all of the participants. If that can be ac~
companied by some further word from you about para~
graph 4, I believe it will contribute to expediting
consideration.

Sincerely yours,
