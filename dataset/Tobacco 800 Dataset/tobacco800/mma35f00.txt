Section Sales Manager J. A. Brennan, III reports the introduction
of Heritage Lights (King and 100) in Baltimore, MD ($4.00 I.S.C. -
30¢ Pack I.S.C.).

Introductory Offer: July 2 - July 27, 1990
$36.00 per Case/30 Day Terms

Due to the Spill In/Spill out associated with the Baltimore area,
the expansion is probably not limited to this specific market.
The allocations are extremely generous (F.A. Davis allocated 117
cases}. Considering the first ship date of July and and the

generous allocations, it appears the expansion is an effort to
replace 2nd quarter units los
