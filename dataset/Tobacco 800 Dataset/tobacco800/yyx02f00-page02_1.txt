Mr. Charles D. Roche
1819 H Street, N.W.
Suite 41o

Washington, D. C. 20006

Dear Mr. Roche:

Thank you very much for your gratifying letter of
August 6th which I have today promptly distributed to
the appropriate representative of each of the nine com-
panies for whom I have been acting.

I do not at this time anticipate any difficulty
with the understandings which you refer to in your let-
ter, It has always been understood that American Chemosol
Corporation or Dr. Hudson would be privileged to safe-
guard the confidentiality of their formula in every way.

As to the establishment, which I take to mean the
detailed formulation, of the protocol, there will certain-
ly be no difficulty about Dr. Hudson being permitted to
review that protocol. On the other hand, it must be under-
stood that what constitutes an adequate procedure for
evaluation must be ultimately determined by the indepen-
dent testing laboratory. In addition, I can assure you
that whatever progress reports are received in the regu-
lar course of reporting from Hazleton will be made avail-
able to the American Chemosol Corporation.

I am confident that you will understand that mid-
August is inescapably a difficult time to finalize any
project because of vacation schedules. I shall ask each
of my principals to act with reasonable expedition.

CONFIDENTIAL:
