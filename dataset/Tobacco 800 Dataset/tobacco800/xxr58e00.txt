Ref.: Moisture Test CORESTA

Dear Bob,

The Coresta Collaborative Test we prepared in 1976 was with
cased and flavored MF Blend.

Standard cut rag was taken and put in a closed rotating
cylinder for one day for moisture equilibrium. The cut rag
was then sieved and only the middle fraction was used for
the test. The samples were sent in double sealed polyethy-
lene bags.

Total weight was labeled on each bag and weight rechecked
at reception ( in each lab.).

Moisture results where too different weights were found,
were not taken into consideration for the final evaluation.

I hope that these informations will be useful to you.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need further
details.

With my best regards,

SO9eE6 T2202
