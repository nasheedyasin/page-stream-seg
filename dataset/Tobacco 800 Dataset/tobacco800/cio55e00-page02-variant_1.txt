Dear Larry:

Last year was, to say the least, a landmark year for Marlboro,
During the last quarter of 1975, Marlboro became the largest
selling cigarette in the industry, and is now the Number One
Brand both in the United States and around the world.

Reaching number one has been a long but most rewarding pro-
cess, andis the result of much hard work on the part of many
people here at Philip Morris. We recognize, however, that
we would not have been able to reach this goal without the
continued cooperation of you and your people.

As a token of our appreciation for your ongoing support and
contribution to Marlboro's success, enclosed is a specially
commissioned plate engraved with Charles M. Russell's
sketch, 'Corozon Reared Straight Up.'' Russell's work
represents the very best in frontier art, and makes an en-
during comment about life in the Old West.

We realize that in order to maintain Marlboro!'s leadership
position and growth momentum, we must continuc to rely
on you for the kind of support we've received for the brand
over the past 20 years.
