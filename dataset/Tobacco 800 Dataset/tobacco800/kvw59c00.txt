Dear Dr. Rawson:

I am delighted that you can participate in the
site visit to Tampa as discussed on the phone.

A check to cover your expenses will be forwarded
to you on receipt of your out-of-pocket costs. A modest
monetary token of our appreciation for your interest and
efforts will follow under separate cover.

You will shortly be receiving from me additional
information on the visit to Dr. Frankel.
