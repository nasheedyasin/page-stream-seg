Re:
Dear Mr.

Lam writing on behalf of the Settling Defendants in response to your letter dated
September 26, 2001, in which you inquired as to how the various credit amounts set forth in the
June 1, 2001 Agreement of Amendment to Settlement Agreement (the “June ] Agreement’)
were calculated,

As you are probably aware, the Settling Defendants made payments pursuant to
the amended Florida Settlement Agreement on or about December 29, 2000 that were based on

estimates of cigarette volume and inflation for the year 2000, and that were calculated using the
incorrect volume adjustment formula as set forth in the then-existing amended Florida Seulement
Agreement (sce attached ietier from Meyer Koplow of this firm to Joseph Rice dated December
29, 2000). It was further agreed that the 2600 payment amount would be adjusted once the
relevant actual yelume and inflation data became available, and once the disputes regarding the
profit adjustment formula und velume adjustment formula were resolved.
