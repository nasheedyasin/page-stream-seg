Dear Dr. Glenn:

Thank you for your letter of April 21. ] am sorry the Council was unable to fund our
work on the mechanisms of signalling via FcyRI. I am interested in applying again for the
coming year to the Council. Since we described CD40 ligand deficiency in Hyper IgM
Syndrome, we are interested in defining the role of the CD40-CD40 ligand interaction in
B cell development. I will call you to find out a) if it is possible to apply, b) the deadlines
and c) the topics that fall within the interest of the council.

Sincerely yours,
