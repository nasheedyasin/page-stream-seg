Ion Exchange Chromatography of Amino Acids

The H* form resin purchased was first converted to the Na‘ form by
passing 2 column volumes of 1.N NaOH through it, followed by rinsing the
resin with 4 column volumes of deionized water. The resin was then packed
into a 1.6 x 100 cm water-jacketed column (reein bed 1.6 x 90 cm), and the
column was equilibrated with 0.2 .N NaOH for 2 hours and then 0.2 N sodium
citrate buffer pH 3.25 for another 2 hours. The flow rate was 1.92
ml/min,

The samples were dissolved in 10 wl of 0.2 N sodium citrate buffer pH 2,2
and applied to the equilibrated colum. A Rheodyne Type 50 Teflon rotary
value with a 10 ml sampling loop was used to load the sample onto the
column, The column was then eluted with 0.2 N sodium citrate buffer pi
3.25 for 5 hours 45 minutes, and then with 0.25 N sodium citrate buffer pH
5.0 for another 21 hours.

Detection of Amino Acids by Post: umn Ninhydrin Reaction

The amino acids eluted from the column were monitored by a post-column

ninhydrin reaction unit, as modifed from a procedure of Ertingshausen,

et al, The unit consists of components from the Technicon AutoAnalyzer

Il system (Technicon Industrial Systems, Tarrytown, NY): 4 multi-channel
peristaltic pump (Pump III), miming coils, a thermostated bath, a colori-
meter, and a recorder. A schematic is shown in Figure 9. The peristaltic
pump was used to pump (1) buffer to and effluent from the chromatographic
column, (2) reagents into the reaction system, and (3) effluent from the
colorimeter, The air-segmented stream of reagents plus column effluent
was fed into the reaction coil which was kept at 95°C in an oil bath. The
absorbance was measured at 550 nn.

Data Reduction

The peak areas in chromatograms were measured in square centimeter units
by using a compensating polar planimeter (Model No. 4236 M, Keuffel &
Esser Co., New York, N¥). Standard calibration curves were constructed by
