RE: DOUBLE BRAND OFFENSIVE DIRECT MAIL - I

TO: THE ENTIRE SALES ORGANIZATION

In January and again in March, we conducted a Priority Brand Direct Mail program that was
mailed to millions of competitive smokers.

This program was such a success for MONTCLAIR and MISTY that we are expanding it. This
time, we will mail to another 1,750,000 smokers on June 15. These competitive smokers will
be receiving a MISTY or MONTCLAIR direct mail piece with trial inducing coupons.

In total, we will have mailed to 5,000,000 competitive smokers!

It is extremely important that when these smokers go to their retail outlets to redeem these
coupons they can easily find our Brands and the correct selling price. Please, maximize our in-
store presence with extra P.O.S. and displays. And, don’t forget to Advance Order incremental

MONTCLAIR and MISTY product for this special Direct Mail Promotional program.

Samples of the MONTCLAIR and MISTY promotions will be appearing in your mail during

the next week.
