RE: Request of No Cost Extension for Grant 3035
Dear Dr. McAllister:

This is to kindly ask you to consider a ‘No Cost Extension’
for my current support from the CTR - U.S.A., Inc. My grant
entitled “Functional Analysis of yes and sre Proto-oncogenes” will be
finished on June 30, 1997. Since there are new and important research
developments that emerged directly from the work supported by the CTR,
I would like to consider applying for the third and final round of support
in a form of a competitive renewal.

Thank you for your advice and consideration.

Yours sincerely,

Moni
