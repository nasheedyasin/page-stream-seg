Dear. Lorratne,

Enclosed is a copy of my travel expenses for the October
meeting, originally sent to Bob Gertenbach.

You will note that the hotel bill does not copy well, and
if you want a copy of. the original bill please contact the hotel.
Also enclosed are some of the chits for a meal and taxi and a
copy of my flight costs,

| trust this will reach you satisfactorily. We have
discovered that. my letter of October 18 was sent to your new
address which explains why it never reached you.

Sincerely yours,

oseph D. Feldman, M.D.
