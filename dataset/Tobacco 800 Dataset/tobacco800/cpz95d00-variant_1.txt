Dear Dr. McAllister:

Case number 3986: Progress report

Since submitting the above referenced grant application, we have obtained
additional data on the association between FcyRI and FceRly, and we have determined the
identity of a sre-type protein tyrosine kinase which becomes hyperphosphorylated
following FcyRI engagement.

1. FeyRl-associated FceRIyis a disulfide-linked homodimer

In our preliminary data, we demonstrated that ac. 14 kD protein is co-precipitated
with FeyRI by anti-FcyRI mAb 197 from digitonin lysates of !251-labeled THP-1 cells.
This protein co-migrated with FceRIy and was recognized by an anti-FceRIly mAb, 4D8.
We have since performed two-dimensional nonreducing-reducing gel electrophoresis on
mAb 197 and mAb 4D8 immunoprecipitates from THP-1 cells. As shown in Figure 1,
both mAb precipitate a spot (indicated by arrow) migrating below the diagonal, indicating
a disufide-linked homodimer. This result provides further confirmation of the identity of
the 14 kD FeyRI-associated protein and FceRly. The role of FceRly homodimer formation
in FcyRI signaling will be further addressed in mutational studies, as detailed in the
proposal.

Lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAb 197 (anti-
FeyRI, left hand panel), or with mAb 4D8 (anti-FceRly, right hand panel), and analyzed by two
dimensional nonreducing/reducing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. First dimension
(nonreducing) runs from left to right; second dimension (reducing) runs from above to below. Arrow
in left hand panel indicates position of c.14 kD off-diagonal spot.
