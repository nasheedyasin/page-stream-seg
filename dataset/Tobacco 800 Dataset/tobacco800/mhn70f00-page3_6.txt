plotting area ratios of each amino acid over the internal standard against
the weight ratios. A computer program was used to carry out linear
regression analysis and construct a line of best fit for each standard
calibration curve. The weight ratio of each residual amino acid against

the internal standard was determined from the line of best fit.
