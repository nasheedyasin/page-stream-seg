Dear Mr.

Upon my return to ton I found your
letter of February 28, 1968, in which you reported
that the only obstacle standing in the way of going
forvard is the insistence upon the inclusion of
paragraph 4 of our proposal of August 1, 1967. You
invited me to use my good offices to expedite this
matter.

As I reported to Mr. Beck in our discussion
---~on February 23rd last, all of the nine participants
in the proposed pr in have indicated that they
could not agree to the elimination of the “most
” favored nation" provision in paragraph 4 of the
August 1, 1967 letter proposal. It was my under-
ng that Mr, Beck would review our discussion
ne a letter outlining the specific
objections he had on this point.

In your letter you submit your view that
it is unfair to impose a restriction “which would
make it virtually impossible for Chemical Research

at arms length with any one of the
companies that might be anxious to use the process."
XZ trust that we are in agreement as to the meaning
of the clause under consideration. It would not,
upon acceptance of @ proposal, preclude Chemical
from negotiating with any cigarette manufacturer
during the course of the testing or at any time
thereafter. It in no way requires relinguishment
