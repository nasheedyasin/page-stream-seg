Dear Dr. Geha: Re: 4369R2

You will remember that as a result of the uncertainties associated with the future
of CTR pending federal legislation, CTR suspended consideration of new and competing
renewal applications. As a result of the suspension, there is a small surplus of research
funds designated for obligation in 1997.

We are now in a position to make available to each of our grantees whose
awards will expire in December 1998 the sum of $25,000 (includiug 15% indirect
costs) as a supplement of your 1998 award. Payment would be made in 1998. Ifyou
would like to avail yourself of this one-time opportunity, please notify us accordingly by
signing in the space provided below. You should then return this signed letter,
accompanied by a short (one page or less) description of how the monies will be used in
furtherance of your pruject already supported by CTR.

We must receive your response by November 30th. We apologize for the short

notice, mandated by our approaching fiscal year end.

Sincerely,

Abas didfiot Saku tO
