In comection with the construction of new nuciear reactors the
BFE (Federal Food Research Institute) and the GRS (Socicty for
Nuclear Reactor Safety) are investigating the levels of radioactive
isotopes in plants. Since tobacco /s grow ir the vicinity of
Planned nuclear reactors, tobacco is part of the invest.

Results of Ua Investigation are intended to be published by

BFE or the Federal Goverment,

During this year two meetings took place and were reported in
tenes dated April 14, ax July 20, 1981.

The findings obtained by the BFE to date are:

~ tobsce> plants nommally pick up radioactivity in the sam range
BS some vegetables; only the Ra-226 levels are tenfold higher in
tobacco tha: in vegetables:

~ Tesults of dried tobacco, however, if incorrectly compared to
fresh vegetables, could be mad√© to loo. worse.

Next steps will be the detailed evaluation of tr results in compa-
rison to the ingestion by food. A mecting.is scheduled for August.
20, 1981,

On occasion of this meeting I expect to be asked again by Dr.
Schelenz of the BFE to provide fluc-cured tobaccce (which are

Mt grown in this country) for comparative analyses. 1 made no
commitment last time and think we should not provide tobaccos.

May I please have your agreement /disagreement on this last part
by August 10, 1981.
