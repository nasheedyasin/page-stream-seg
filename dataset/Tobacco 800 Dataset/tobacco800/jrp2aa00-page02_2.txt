Of the Friday sessions I was particularly impressed with Jim Travisâ€™
approach to protein chemistry and the utilization of his meticulous techniques
for the investigation of proteolytic enzymes. Here is a built in quality control
for any exper iments your other grantees may conduct in this difficult field.
The work he is doing is basic and of high quality.

In the final paper, Shirley Kaufnhan demonstrated once again her sound
grasp of the cytodynamics of the lung, She has developed a reliable and repro-
ducible model for cellular quantitation; now she has to decide what definitive
experiments can be built around this precise model.

These are hurried and somewhat extemporaneovs comments but if I don't
write them down and mail them to you today, chances are that you'll never have
any comments at all!

Once again, my thanks to you and your staff for a delightful and thought
provoking meeting, It is hard to document the benefits that accrue from personal
interchanges during such a small meeting, but I'm certainly glad I came,

With best wishes.

Yours sincerel
