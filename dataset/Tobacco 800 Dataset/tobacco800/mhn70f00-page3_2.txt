resolution before it can de more widely used, For our study, a prepa-
rative cation exchange chromatographic procedure for {solatin of sugar~
amino acid complexes was modified for the separation of the seven starting
amino acids, since an in-house amino acid analyzer was not available; and
the Product Department requested that this sample not be analyzed by an

outside laboratory.

Results and Discussion

Leucine (5 mg, the internal standard) was added to a 2-g portion of

HETCAL, and the sample was applied to a cation exchange columa (u*

form). After washing with water to remove unbound material, the column was
eluted with 7 N WH,OH to give the bound material, which was then
freeze-dried to give a residue of 346.1 mg. This material contained the
amino acids from METCAL and leucine, A 60 mg aliquot of this sample was
chromatographed on Na* form cation exchange resin (see Appendix for

experimental details),

Figure 1 (Panel A) shows the chromatogram of the bound material (amino
acid fraction) from METCAL, in which aspartic acid, valine, and phenyl-
alanine were the major residual amino acids. Two unknown peaks were
observed, The first unknown peak eluted between valine and leucine,

The second unknown peak eluted at 15.5 hr. These unknown peaks did not
correspond to any starting amino acid. Figure 1 (Panel B} shows a typical
chromatogram of one of a series of standard amino acid mixtures. These
standatd amino acid mixtures contained a fixed amount of leucine end
increasing amounts of the other amino acids. Figures 2 - 8 show the
standard calibration curves.

Table I summarizes the results of the analyses. Valine, aspartic acid,

and phenylalanine were found to be the major residual amino acids present
at 1.5%, 0.45%, and 0.18% by weight of METCAL, respectively. Glutamic
acid, glutamine, and histidine were estimated to be below 0.03% each; and
proline was estimated to be below 0.07%.
