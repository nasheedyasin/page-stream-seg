RE: Grant #3035R2 (A)
Dear Drs. Glenn and McAllister:

This is to thank you very much for the supplement to my current grant award
in the sum of $35,000. The acceptance note plus a brief budget are enclosed.

I would like to express once again my appreciation of the generous support for
research which I have obtained from the CTR. The discovery of the WW domain, a new
signaling module that is implicated in several diseases including: cancer, a genetic form of
hypertension known as Liddle Syndrome, Muscular Dystrophy and Alzheimerâ€™s Disease,
was made possible because of your original support of a seed project that involved several
risky approaches (for example the anti-idiotypic method to isolate proteins which
communicate with an oncogene product). In addition, in sharp contrast to many other
funding agencies, the CTR review panel consisted of top leaders and distinguished
scientists.

The news of dissolving The Council for Tobacco Research is sad indeed. On
various forums and in different directions ] voice my strong support for your public health
service through cultivation of the innovative biomedical research. I still have hope that the
CTR will be revived.

With kind regards,

Yours sincerely,
/
