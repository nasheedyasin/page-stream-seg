The respiratory system offers a variely of â€œcapture
er. sections" for particles. These are particle
size dependent. The entry surface area of the
respiratory system is relatively small Gn comparison
to total surface available to smoke particles) thus not
only particle size but effective concentration enters
into the problem.

Because of the room, coagulation rates, respiratory
cross sections, gradient effects in the room cannot
be ignored, This leads lo strong questioning of the
homogenous mixing assumption.

The validity of "what if we assume EPA outdoor
standards and apply them indoors" is certainly open
to debate. Since these standards are set rigidly to
consider dilution, wind, distance to detectors, they
heavily overweigh the indoor situation, Under these
standards, cooking or dusting in one's own home
would probably violate one of the levels.

I hope the above comments are of some use to you. If there are any
questions or points to be raised, please contact me.
