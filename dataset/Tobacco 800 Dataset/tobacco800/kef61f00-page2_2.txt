RESULTS

It has been proposed that the Amadori compounds (the intermediate sugar-
amino acid complex from Maillard reactions) upom thermal degradation would
give flavor compounds such as furans, furanones, pyranones, pyrroles,
pyrazines, etc. The sweet flavor compounds identified so far in the ether
extract (Table I) belong to these categories.

Figure 1 gives the masa spectal total ion chromatogram of the ether extract.
Table II gives a list of flavor compounds related to Maillard reactions as a
result of literature review of pertinent studies.

The possibility of the presence of Amadori compounds in the aqueous fraction
of the reaction "A" mixture is being investigated. Nevertheless, application
of Amadori compounds instead of the volatile flavor compounds (produced upon
pyrolysis) may prove to be a better approach to impart Maillard reaction-type
aroma to tobacco smoke,
