Chairman, Tobacco Industry hesearch Committee,

Dear Mr. McComas:

I wish to acknowledge your letter of the
nineteenth and to say that I shall be very glad to accept
the position of Scientific Director and as such, ex officio,
Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board for the period of
one year from June firet, 1954, ‘The conditions mentioned in
your letter are entirely satisfactory.

The position is an interesting and important
one not only in its own right but beceuse if the Council
with proper advice, assumes a constructive planning function,
we oar set a pattern for support of basie research, Such a
pattern has long been needed and eny part in creating it

will be a real contribution felt in every field of scientific
endeavor.

I think it should be mutually agreed that
4f any time during the yoar the Council feels that I am not
doing the job as it should be done, or if I feel that I cannot
give adequate time or thought, we ehould feel free to terminate
the egreement without continued financial obligation on your

part.

I hope that in the not distant future we can
sit down together and make arrangements for me to meet the other
members of the Industry's Committee so that we can all get better
acquainted.

With kindest personal regards,
I am
Sincerely yours,

Cc. C. Little.
