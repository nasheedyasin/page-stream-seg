Dear Dr. Carchman:

| received a fax from Dr. Walk on Sept 9, 1997 to obtain more information on a news
report entitled “Group to initiate sick building syndrome study” (see attachment No. 1).
The same news report was also supplied by Dr. Kolier on Sept 12, 1997.

In response to the above, I requested a Japanese media article search on “Sick Building
Syndrome” by an outside company, and at the same time | executed an Intemet search.

As the results, media articles describing the following projects initiated by the Japanese

Government were obtained:
(1) the above project, initiated by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MIT),

(2) a joint project by the Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Health and Welfare
(MHVV), the MITI, and the Forestry Agency, and
(3) & project by the MHW.

For summary translations of media articles regarding (1) and (2), see attachment No. 2.
Regarding (3), see attachment No. 3, which is the summary translation of a report from
the subcommittee obtained via the Internet.

The above projects will be continued to be monitored and will be reported to you and
colleagues if significant new developments become known to us.

Best regards,
