Dear Alan,

As we discussed, I have attached copies of our Direct Marketing Budget for 1993 and our
database update schedule. These items may help you get up to speed quickly.

Some of the other things that we discussed you may want to follow-up on. They are as
follows:

@* Procedures Manual on database processes with MIT (Janice Liscinsky started working
with them on this).

Cost and lead time guidelines for list pulls, database counts and other database-related
projects.

We started using a new process of sequentially-coding preprinted bouncebacks and then
later matching them up to pincodes of respondents. This process was used for
MONTCLAIR Trial #1 and the CARLTON Challenge bouncebacks but we are not yet
sure that this process worked. We'd like to know how successful this has been soon.

Response/recommendation back to us on why our Nixie rates have been increasing.
Monthly ‘Tracking Report information on how many names are new and how many

names were updated by PM tape (started working with Susan Levey on this).
