Dear Mr. Pepples:

This letter will acknowledge the with-
drawal of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation’s
pledge to pay up to the sum of $10,000 to Californians
for Common Sense to discharge its obligations to
Woodward & McDowell specifically provided for by
Paragraph V of the agreement between Californians
for Common Sense and Woodward & McDowell if the
Clean Indoor Air ballot measure had not qualified
for the November election. The ballot measure has
qualified; therefore, the withdrawal of your
pledge is accepted and will be recorded on the
next campaign statement filed by Californians for
Common Sense.

Very truly yours,

‘o G.] Nielsen, Jr.
