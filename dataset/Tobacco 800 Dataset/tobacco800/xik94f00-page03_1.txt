Dear Mr. Beck:

When I got back this morning I found your
letter of September 19th which in part covered what
you told me in our telephone conversation of that day.

I share your hope that we.can expedite the
implementation of the proposal I gave you in my letter:
of August 1, 1967, following the visit to High Tor on
July 19th. As we both are aware, going forward has
been unhappily delayed by Dr. Hudson's preparation
for the hearings before the Senate Subcommittee, the
absence on vacation in early August of some of the
Research Directors, your being out of the country in
early September, and the developed necessity for the
Hazelton Laboratory people having to talk with Dr.
Hudson before a testing protocol could be finalized.

Following our telephone talk on September 11,
which was the first opportunity we had to talk on your
return from Bermuda, and in which I told you that the
Hazelton Laboratory people wanted to check certain
setentific points with Dr,-Hudson, I understand that

_ he talked with Mr. James Gargus of that organization.
Thereafter, it was my understanding that Mr. Gargus
would, with Dr. Robert Weir of Hazelton, work up a
final protocol to be submitted to the Research Direc-
tors of the companies, and after approval be sent to
me for submission to you in accordance with your re-
quest in our talk on August 10th, that everything go
to you. i .
