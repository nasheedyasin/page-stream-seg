a) Dr. Neurath: The influence of the nicotine content on the N-PAH concentra-
tion in tobacco smoke. For that purpose plain cigarettes (based on E76 blend)
with varying amounts of nicotine (added via nicotine impregnated HTL) will
be used. Condensate of 3000 - 5000 cigarettes will be collected and ana-
lyzed. The N-PAH fraction will be separated via HPLC and the components will

be identified by means of GC/MS.

In addition, tobacco and smoke will be analyzed by common routine methods
(e.g. ash content, total nitrogen content).

The use of radioactively labelled nicotine as,.alternative was discussed -
no decision.

Prof. Grimmer: Determination and importance of nitrogenous tobacco ingredients
fror. trimmer: ve
which can be defined as N-PAH precursors.

A list of nitrogenous components of tobacco was prepared and the proposal
made to add these compounds (e.g. amino acids, nitrates, protein, amines) to
the tobacco blend as impregnated HTL foil and analyse for their role in the
formation of N-PAH.

The results of this first task force meeting were discussed in the Tabakforschungs-â€”
ausschuB (TFA) of the Verband on January 15, 1981.

To discuss further details a second task force meeting will be held in Vienna
on February 12, 1981. RJR will be represented by 0. Stuhl.

The following questions will be discussed:

- whether to start the research project a) with unlabelled nicotine at first and
then later repeat it with labelled nicotine.

where is '5y-1abelled nicotine avialable (PM?, Austria?),

who will produce the HTL and the complete cigarettes,

what the' implications were of using otherwise labelled nicotine.

how other potential precursors could be labelled.
