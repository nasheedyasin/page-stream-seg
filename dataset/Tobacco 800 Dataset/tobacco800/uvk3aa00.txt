Dear Mr. Florant:

Under. separate cover we are returning three (3) new
smoking machines at Dr, Kreisher's request for alteration
in design recently made by The Council of Tobacco Research.
In addition we need the replacement of flow meters and the
animal holder returned to you on December 28, 1971. We are
also returning an older model smoking machine at Dr.
Kreisher's request. Please expedite the alteration of the
three new machines and return them as we have experiments
we would like to undertake.

Thank you for your cooperation.
