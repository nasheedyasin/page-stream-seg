ALLLARD MPONENTS

Identification of flavor mponents i @ s la of the Maillard
teaction "A" mixture is reported in this communication. Subfractions fron
preparative gas chromatography were analyzed by fused silica capillary
CC/mass spectrometry. Experimental details are described in the Appendi

Figure I shows the preparative gas chromatogran. Table 1 lists the odor
transition observed organoleptically at the GC exit port during the
period each subfraction was being eluted. Table I1 lists in the order
of increasing GC retention time the components identified by capillar
GC/M: Components tentatively identified are indicated by an asterisk
(*). Relative abundance of the identified components within each sub-
fraction is indicated by peak sizes: +, small; ++, medium; and +++,
large.

Amadori compounds from various amino acids and glucose or fructose have
been found by many food flavor investigatora to be the flavor precursors
in Maillard reaction. The fact that Amadori compounds are more polar and
have higher molecular weights would probably make them stay longer in the
finished tobacco products than the volatile flavor molecules. Synthetic
methods and isolation procedures for Amadori compounds have been obtained
through literature search Studies on the effect(s) of Amadori compound
on cigarettes to produce the desirable Maillard reaction aroma seem worth-
while pursuing.
