Based on the latest Government release of "tar" and nicotine figures,
the City of New York tax on PALL MALL Menthol 100's Cigarettes will
be decreased from 4 cents to 3 cents per package of 20 cigarettes
effective March 16, 1973.

Therefore, at the close of business March 15, you are to take an
inventory of the packages of PALL MALL Menthol 100's in your pos-
session bearing New York City tax stamps. Forward that inventory
to this office March 16 so that we may obtain a refund from New
