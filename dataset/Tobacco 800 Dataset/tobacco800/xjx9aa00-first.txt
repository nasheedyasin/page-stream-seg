Dear Bob,

It is strange indeed to realize this is my be the last letter
I shall write to you as President of C.T.R. When I was Â£irst

appointed to the Board, you were there and, throughout the past ten

years you have given me your full support. I appreciate in

particular your efforts to find a way around the probiem associated

with a non-resident earning money in the U.S.A.

For this and for the many courtesies you have shown to me and to
Joyce, I thank you.

We will, I hope, see you and Carol in Florida next February and I

wish you both a long and happy retirement.

Yours sincerely
