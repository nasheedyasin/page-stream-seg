Dear Dr. Gardner:

I received your letter regarding Dr. Wilson at
University of Colorado. We would be happy to have
someone from his laboratory spend a day or so with us.
This should be timed when Mr. Agustin Lopez is here as
he is the technician most familiar with the instrument.

As to the animal holders, we see no difference in
uptake of smoke, however, ft depends on whether or not
Dr. Wilson will be worried about nicotine on the fur and
continued exposure through the residue on the fur. The
advantage of the cones is that ten mice can be exposed
per side instead of six mice with the neck holders.

The CoHb has been done only on 2Al cigarettes at
this time. We have scheduled the @R1 for the first of
the year. Dr. Henry can discuss our finding with
Dr. Wilson, :

The dosimetry papers are at ORNL for their final
reviston. We should be able to get preprints to Dr. Wilson
by the end of January, .

We will be happy to help Dr. Wilson in any way.
We will be most anxious to see what he finds out about
genetic aspects of nicotine behavior.

Best wishes for Christmas and the New Year.

Sincerely,

Carrie E. Whitmire, Ph.D.
