Dear Lorraine,

It was good seeing you again at the recent SAB meeting. Thank you for your help
with the Social Security matter. I am enclosing my expense account for the recent
SAB meeting, which totals $2375.17. You will see that receipts are attached for each
of the nine out-of-pocket expenses. Where Sterling expenses are involved, an

exchange rate of 1.70 was employed.

I hope that you find this in order and I would appreciate my expenses and per diem
paid in the usual manner into my Citibank account.

With kind regards,

Yours sincerely,

que

Jeffrey R. Idle
