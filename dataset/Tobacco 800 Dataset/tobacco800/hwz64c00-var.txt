. Dear Sir:

Please note that on the enclosed check we have deducted a

20% credit from the True ad that ran in Beumont Enterprise on
July 18. The ad in question was backed by coupon even though we
specifically stated on the insertion order that this was

unacceptable.

Lorillard Media Services has always held that an ad backed by
coupon does not receive full advertising value. After discussing
the situation with our agencies and newspaper representatives, we
agreed that a 20%.credit was indeed fair.

If you wish to contact me concerning this situation, please. call
me at (212) 841-8868.

Sincerely,

Stephen M. Molloy
