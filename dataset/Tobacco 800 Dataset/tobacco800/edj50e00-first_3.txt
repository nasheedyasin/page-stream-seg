As we discussed by phone, the disposition of records is a rather large
undertaking and may be quite time-consuming. I will be more than happy,
Gene, to facilitate this process in any way possible and certainly look
foward to working with you, John, Alan, and Al in disposing of this
Matter as rapidly and expeditiously as possible. As we further discussed,
unanticipated issues/questions are likely to arise as we proceed, and

we will certainly address those questions at that time to reach a
mutually agreeable solution.

I look forward to seeing you on the 23rd.

Sincerely,

Hallie S. Jessup
