Dear Dr. Kausch:

I am arranging to send the following three blends with the
corresponding quantities indicated to the attention of Mr. Schmekel.

Burley Blend: 100 kg
Flue-cured Blend: 100 kg
Oriental Blend: 35 kg

These will be in the strip form and will be at a moisture content of
around 13.0%. The alkaloid contents will be close to the tobaccos
that you processed earlier for us.

My immediate needs are for abaut 50 kg of each of Burley and Flue~—cured
blends. I would, therefore, appreciate if these quantities could be
processed and returned to me at your earliest convenience. Target
Alkaloids should be near zero.

Rest of the tobaccos may be processed at your convenience and returned
to us during the next three months.

I have plans to send further quantities of tobacco for storage at
your end for any future extraction should a need for such extracted
tobaccos arise in the near future. We will be in a better position
to assess such needs after experimenting with these intial quantities.

There is a degree of urgency ou this project because of an anticipated

change in product mix in the domestic market. We thank you for your
help and cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brot to8 °
