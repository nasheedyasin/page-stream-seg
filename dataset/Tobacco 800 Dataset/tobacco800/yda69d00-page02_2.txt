a) Smokin: d carcinogenesis: Only about one page (all in all) is dedicated
to smokin g-

o Smoking is considered a habit which increases cancer risk (chapters
III - p. 4, IV - p. 17) and promotes cancer (chapter IV - p. 17).

o On the other hand it is conceded that the lung cancer rate in males and
females has been nearly stagnant over the last 10 years.

o That matter of fact is however described as "non contradictory", because
lung cancer does arise after an incubation period of 20-years (chapter

II] - p. 5). No reference is made to cigarettes consumption over that
time period. :

o Contradictory in that context is the statement that up to 90 % of the
lung cancer are induced by noxious environmental factors (chapter IV- p. 17).

Cancer Register: It is planned to establish cancer registers on a regional
asis. They shall contain type of cancer (diagnosis), stage of cancer growth,
therapy, possible metastases, cause of death.

Parliamentary discussion: The cancer report was discussed in the 9th German
Federal Parlianent (Bundestag) January 21, 1981 (Parliamentary Protocol
9/14 pp. 433 (A) - 437 (D)).

In the review of the Minister of Youth, Family Affairs and Health smoking
was not mentioned.

The parliamentariansof the ruling SPD (Social Democrats) and opposition

CDU (Christian democrats) however requested restrictive measures against .
smoking and tobacco advertising, (because of its proven harmful consequences
to smokers), whereas SPD-coalition-partner FDP (Liberals) warned to accept

smoking as a harmful hazard since there were still many scientific doubts
and inconsistencies.

a,

All three political parties principally supported the establishment of cancer
registers, although they realized it will collidewith the law on the protection

of personal data.
