National Expansion/Funding
@ National expansion would be incorporated into 1981 planning

should test market performance indicate viability of the
program.

Summary

The Business Building Program is recommended to evaluate the Brand's
ability to arrest its projected share of category decline. The plan

is highly attractive financially despite increased spending in the out
years. The program acknowledges switching gains among young adults and
appropriately capitalizes on the Brand's inherent product and advertis-
ing appeal to this segment.

Next Steps

Your approval please for commencement of test marketing
