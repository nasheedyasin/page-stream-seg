Mr H. Maxwell,

Philip Morris International,

NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10017
U.S.A.

Dear Hamish,

Attached are two substantial factory upgrade proposals supporting capital
requests for the Tobacco Company primary totalling U.S.$15.147 million
and the make/pack area for U.S.$5.326 million.

These proposals result from a comprehensive study of our present facility,
our competitive position in terms of quality and productivity plus the
company's needs over the next five years or so.

Presently B.A.T. in Australia are investing A$60 million in N.S.W. in
order to consolidate their two existing plants into one modern facility.
Rothmans on the other hand, with the equivalent of PML's total volume in
one brand, have greater opportunity to realise productivity gains from
high speed equipment.

Our present primary and secondary equipment, with the exception of a small
number of Mark Nine makers and Focke packers, is essentially 10 to 20
years old. Also the factory layout is still affected by the purchase of
Godfrey Phillips in the early 1970s resulting in the operation of two
factories, Virginia and blended within the one facility. This results in
poor utilisation and material handling efficiencies and it is our view
that equipment integration and upgrade can greatly improve our product
quality and efficiency.

In addition to the unnecessary split of Virginia and blended on the
secondary floor, this facility also suffers from the rapid shift of the
company's production from 20's HLP to 25's HLP over the last six years.
The 25's capacity was achieved by locally engineered conversions from
existing 20's equipment.
