Dear John:

This is a confirmation of my request for two trays of the RILT filters
(i.e., the filter containing two tubes cut by a circumferential
groove) that we discussed on the phone last Priday.

We alao have am interest in three of the filter designe you described
in your letter of June 14 to Hugh Honeycutt. These are the designs
shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6, We plan te hand-make some prototypes of
these designs for an initial evaluation. I will keep you informed of
progress in this area,

It was good to talk to you again and I certainly appreciate all the
support you have given us. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Kelby St, hats
