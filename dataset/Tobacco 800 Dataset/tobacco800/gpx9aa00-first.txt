Dear Tom,

A brief note to thank you and the members of your
staff for a most enjoyable and intellectually stimulating
few days in New York. Your invitation to join the Scientific
Advisory Board opens up an interesting new field for me and

it will be a signal honor to join such a distinguished group
of scientists.

On a more mundane level, my expense account is
enclosed!

Yours sincerely,

Drummond H. Bowden, M.D.
