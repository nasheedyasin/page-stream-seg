Dear Dr. David:

This letter formally changes the name of the subchronic inhala-
tion study from "90-Day Subchronic..." to "13-Week Subchronic
Smoke Inhalation Study in Rats." Please make this change on
future protocols and reports. Do not change draft reports which
have already been issued under the former name.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call.
