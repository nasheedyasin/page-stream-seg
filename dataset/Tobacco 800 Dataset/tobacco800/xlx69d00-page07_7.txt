3. kKeordering and Storing of Denicotinized Green Burley Tobacco

All of the denicotinized products were sent to No. 1 Leaf House. After
weighing and sespling for moisture content, they vere reordered since moisture
control vas rather poor in the reordering section of the dryer at Factory
Ko. 64 while it was being used to remove nicotine. The products vere sempled
and weighed again as they were packed in hogsheade for storage at Shed No.
154. The unaccounted for weight lose was erratic during the reordering
operation, probably because of the amall batches run and screp loss. Some
rewnants from different lots were combined to permit packing in hogsheads.
These were given indicative labels to distinguish them from the separate lote.

The data on the reordered material are tabulated here.
