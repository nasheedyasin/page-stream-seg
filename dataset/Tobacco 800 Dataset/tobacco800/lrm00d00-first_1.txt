Dear Arthur:

This short note is to ask you for permission to transfer $7,000 of
unspent budget from the last year (7/1/95 - 6/30/96) to the current fiscal
year (7/1/96). My move from the Rockefeller University to the Mount
Sinai School of Medicine, and changes in personnel, were in part
responsible for inefficient control of the budget.

T hope you will visit my new laboratory at Mount Sinai in the near future.

Yours sincerely,

Marius Sudol, Ph.D.

Associate Professor
