Use of Concentrated G-7 Extract

The No. 4 Dryer at 90-3 was operated with extract of about 25 per cent
solid content on the wet end for a total of approximately 19 hours during two
runs. The dryer was run at about 320 ft./min. for nearly 5 hours and at
about 310 ft./min. for the remainder of the time without significant difficulty.
At the top speed production increase was approximately 10 per cent above normal
rates without concentrated extract (normal dryer speed 285-295 ft./min.).

The use of concentrated extract will be shifted from the wet end to the
product end sprays of the dryer during the coming week in order to see the
advantage of using the higher strength extract there.
