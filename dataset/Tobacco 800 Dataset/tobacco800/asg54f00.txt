SUBJECT: Interlaboratory Results - Test #11

Enclosed is a summary of data for interlaboratory test #11 as
reported by the participating laboratories. Tables I thru VI
reveal the means and standard deviations for "Tar", Nicotine,

de, Puff, TPM and Water.

Figures 1 thru 3 illustrate the least square regression lines
of each laboratory's mean against the mean of all laboratories for
the seven samples tested. These graphs were done for "Tar",
Nicotine and Carbon Monoxide. Included in each figure is the
listing of intercepts and slopes of the regression lines. As
indicated, the listed order of the laboratory's statistics
correlates to the intercepts of the Y-axis at each extreme.

Sincerely,

Hille? Daggt
