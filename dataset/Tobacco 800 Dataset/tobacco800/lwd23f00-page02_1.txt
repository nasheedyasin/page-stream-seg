Attached are copies of the proposals. and designs for these tests.
Also, you will find the product codes and amount of product ordered.

Cost® authorized for each of these projects is $57,000.

Staci, since our last CPT together, a Product Testing Methodology
Task Force has issued guidelines regarding questionnaire order.
Specifically:

“Overall ratings can be influenced by whether overall
likeability is asked before or after attributes in the
questionnaire, The task force agreed that the order of
the questionnaire would be 1) dislikes and likes in an
open-ended format, 2) attribute ratings, and 3) likeability
or " preference to own brand."
Please be sure to conform to this question order when designing any
and all future CPT questionnaires.

I will inform you of the final shipment date. Let me know if any
changes are necessary in the following address:
