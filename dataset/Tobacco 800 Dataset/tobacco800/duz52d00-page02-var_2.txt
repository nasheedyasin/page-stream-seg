Re: Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Costs
Submission

Dear Mr. Acosta:

i have your letter of January 18, 1999, regarding the costs submission for the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Based upon a conversation with Andy Berly’s assistant at Ness,
Motley, I understand that your cost materials have been received by them but that a Cost
Statement for the Commonweaith has not yet been submitted to the Original Participating
Manufacturers,

Please do not forward a copy of your firm’s cost summary to us at this time. Your
December 14, 1998, letter to Meyer G. Koplow indicates that yau have chosen Joe Rice of Ness,
Motley to be the Designated Representative for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rice {at least for
purposes of submitting a Cost Statement to the Original Participating Manufacturers). We will
await the submission of a single Outside Counsel Cost Statement for the Commonwealth as a
whole, and upon receipt of such a Statement will consider it promptly, subject of course to our
right to insist upon a full audit and to contest the reimbursability of any particular amounts.
