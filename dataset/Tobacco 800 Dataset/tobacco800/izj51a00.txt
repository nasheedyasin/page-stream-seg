Dear Mr. Lougee:

We have been advised that counsel for the Class A members

of The Council have approved an increase in the salary of Dr. ___
Frederick B. Giller, Director of the Literature Retrieval Division,

from $57,000 to $65,000 effective April 1, 1981. Dr. Giller does not
have an established range. His last salary adjustment was January 1,
1980. It has been generally agreed Dr. Giller's salary has been too low
for his assignment. He does a good job and we agree that this action
should be taken; however, such an increase requires the approval of the

Board of Directors exercisable through the Executive Committee. f

If you approve, please so indicate on the enclosed enclosed copy Â¢ of
(i, this letter and return the sameto-this orrice.

ney D. Hobbs:
