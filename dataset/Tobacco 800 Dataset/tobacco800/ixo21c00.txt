Re: Propesed Memo to Employees
Rear Art:

It is Friday, and a very busy Friday at that,
and I have just received your letter of October 24,
1977 requesting some proposed lanquaqe for a letter to
be sent to corporate employees when the opposition
campaign actually begins.

The attached summary is being dictated
hastily. It should obviously be revised by the fine
hands of Woodward and McDowell and the members of the
Steering Committee. But I forward it at your request
so that there will be something for discussion at
Monterey. JI am also forwarding a copy to Blucher,
Jack, Jack and Dick, who can bring their copies with
them.

I would strongly recommend that no letter
be circulated to employees until the Steering
Committee actually commences the campaian, and I
would think that al] members of the Sleering Committee
should consider a similar or identical letter for
their own sales force in California.

I will be in Monterey a1} Priday and will be
pleased to discuss this further with you and the other
members of the Committee or Counsel at that time.

Very Lrydy your,

awh?
