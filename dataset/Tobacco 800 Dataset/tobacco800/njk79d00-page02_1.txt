Subject: LEM Full Flavor Prime Prospect Recommendation

SA

Purpose

Seek approval to a refined prime prospect definition for SALEM Full
Flavor.

Background

The Product Group identified to Management a concern that the cur~

rent 1980 media plan under delivered the target audience vs. total

adults. This shortfall resulted primarily from a very broad target
age demographic of 18+. Additionally, the original composition of

the prime prospect (50% current franchise/50% segment profile) did

not recognize switching data. This omission understated the impor-
tance in the prime prospect definition of males and young adults

who evidenced superior switching performance On SALEM King's.

Therefore, the definition of the prime prospect was reexamined to
appropriately acknowledge switching performance and improve the
effectiveness of the media plan against the target audience.

â€˜

Recommendation

Revise sex and age as follows in the prime prospect profile for
King's/100's combined:

Prime Prospect pefinition
Recommended current

54% Men 523 Men
18-34 (523%) 18+

See Exhibit I for complete
prime prospect definition.

Rationale

1. King's prime prospect adjusted to reflect switching perfor-
mance.
