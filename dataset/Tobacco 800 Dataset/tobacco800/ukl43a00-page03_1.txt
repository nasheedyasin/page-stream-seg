Dear Dr. Jensen:

This report is to inform you of the principal events which
transpired during the visit of Dr. Spears and myself to

the laboratory of Dr. Wynder at the Sloan-Kettering Institute,
New York City, during the week of October 19th to octoher 23rd,
1959.

The purpose of the visit was to observe the three-day method
for determination of polycyclic compounds = principally
3,4~benzpyrene - in cigarette smoke condensate recently
developed by Dr. D. Hoffmann and his associates. The
following paragraphs contain a detailed account of the
procedure used by these workers.

A sample of tar which weighs 10-20 g. after drying overnight
in vacuum over calcium chloride is completely dissolved in
20 ml. of cyclohexane saturated with a mixture of methanol
and water (4:1) and transferred to a 250 ml. separatory
funnel. The last traces of tar are rinsed from the flask
into the separatory funnel with two 10 ml. portions of
cyclohexane. This cyclohexane solution is then extracted
three times with a solution of methanol-water (4:1) and the
alcoholic portions discarded. The remaining cyclohexane
solution is evaporated to dryness under reduced presaure
at.a température not exceeding 50°C,

The resulting brown residue is redissolved in 40 ml. of
cyclohexane saturated with nitromethane, and this solution
is extracted in a 250 ml. separatory funnel with four 40 ml.
portions of nitromethane. The nitromethane extracts are
combined and evaporated to dryness under vacuum at less
than 50°C.
