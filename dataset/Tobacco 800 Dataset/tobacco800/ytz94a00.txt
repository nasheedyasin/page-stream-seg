Dear Mr. Wade:
This will confirm my telephoned assignment of the above matter to your

office. As we discussed, Mr. Auch informed us that he is being
represented by counsel; but identity of counsel is not yet known.

Please contact claimant as soon as possible and let my office know the
damages claimant is alleging. Your settlement authority limit for
products liability claims is $500.00.

Iâ€™ve enclosed a plastic container to be used if you are able to obtain
cigarettes from the claimant. Please mail them to our Richmond office
at the following address:

Mr. David Curle
