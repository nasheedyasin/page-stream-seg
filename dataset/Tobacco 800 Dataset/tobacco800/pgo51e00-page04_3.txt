e "An epidemic (of lung cancer) among men has existed for
years, now it is being repeated among women," the Surgeon General
claimed. The "reason", according to TIME: "lung cancer may
take decades to develop, and women began taking up smoking in
large numbers only after World War II." That sounds simple,
but this reasoning ignores the fact that the type of lung cancer
most prevalent among women (and nonsmokers) is adenocarcinoma -- a
cell type very weakly associated with smoking. This phenomenon was
confirmed in a recent study at the Mayo Clinic. No one bothered to
ask the Surgeon General about it.

e On the subject of "passive smoking", TIME reported that "The
Surgeon General cites two studies that showed increased risk of lung
cancer in nonsmoking women who are married to smokers." In fact,
the report cited three studies. The third and largest, by thé
American Cancer Society, did not support the hypothesis. The other
two studies cited have been vigorously criticized in the scientific
literature. At the Surgeon General's press conference, Dr. Brandt
also said the evidence from the two positive studies "is not coneclu-
sive by any stretch of the imagination." TIME says the findings
“are considered preliminary." -

Mr. Cave, the government does not have all the answers about
smoking and health. No one on this earth knows exactly how a
normal, healthy cell becomes cancerous. This rather long letter is
written in the hope that TIME, covering the subject of smoking and
health in the future, can set an example of depth and objectivity.

Copies of pertinent information, including recent Congressional
testimony of just a few of the eminent medical researchers and

epidemiologists who question the "conventional wisdom" about
smoking, are enclosed for your review.
