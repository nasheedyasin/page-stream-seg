Re: KENT Advertisements in

"TWA Ambassador" Magazine

Dear Ron:

This letter confirms our recent discussions on the captioned
matter.

As we discussed, the ads in question are intended to be clearly
linked to in-flight duty-free sales. We believe the linkage is
adequately accomplished by the proximity of the ads to the
duty-free price list and the direct reference in that list to
the KENT product. We have instructed and will continue to
instruct TWA to insert our advertising only in the immediate
proximity to the duty-free price list of "TWA Ambassador"
Magazine. This advertising always appears on the same page as
and contiguous to the duty-free price list.

You have our assurance that the in-flight duty-free market is
Our only interest in advertising in the "TWA Ambassador"
magazine, and that any advertisements in other U.S. airline
in-flight magazines which might be distributed to Passengers on
flights or flight segments solely within the U.S. do or will
conform to the same standards as in the "TWA Ambassador."

This agreement will serve to confirm that the advertising
described above, including that which has been the subject of
Our correspondence, is covered by the terms of the Limited
Trademark and Trade Name Agreement, dated June 22, 1977,
