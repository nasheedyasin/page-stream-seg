Dear ina, _

Thank you far your time today with our several conversations Over tha telephone. I’m |
writing to.confirm the agreement we raached regarding Mariboro Racing Experience and California :
SportService. itis my understanding that we are all in agreement that for the next round of the -
Marlboro Racing Experience which is September 21* through October 6", Marlboro will.continue
to purchase all food and beverage items directly from California SpottService. Beginning with the
. Marlboro Racing Experience scheduled to start on November 6" and continue on various days
through December 15*, Marlboro will be able to conduct their own food and beverage service
without the invelvement of California SportService. in consideration of this privilege Marlboro
agrees to pay California SportService a self-catering fee of $2,500 per day for each event food
service day. Set up and tear dawn days will not require any self-catering fee. Marlboro will be
invoiced by California SportService on a monthly basis for all event day self-catering fees.
This agreement will remain in effect for the balance of 2000 and ail scheduled Mariboro
Racing Experience event food service days in 2001. The self-catering fee will be reviewed and
potentially modified by mutual agreement for 2002 and beyond, A formal agreernent will be
provided by our legal department in the near future as this is intended only to confirm our verbal
agreement.
