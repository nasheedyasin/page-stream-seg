Dear Bob:

Confirming our conversation of January 23, we wish you to cancel
recruitment of 200 smokers of TAREYTON 100’s Cigarettes. These
panelists were designated Group II in John Brooks’ letter of
January 10. In reference to that letter, Panels A and B are to
proceed as indicated and Panels C and D are to be terminated.
Obviously, we also ask that you disregard sections of the letter
requesting comparisons between Group I and II results.

Thank you for your typically efficient and gracious handling of this
matter. If you have any questions, please contact me.

Sincerely,
Zt ed
