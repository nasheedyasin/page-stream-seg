The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch
United States Senator
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary

United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 10610-6275

Dear Senator Hatch:

At the October 29, 1997 hearing of the Subcommittee on
Antitrust, Business Rights and Competition, you asked for Philip
Morris’s estimate of the retail price of cigarettes in 2002 and
2007 that would result if the national tobacco settlement as

proposed on June 20 were enacted into law.

Philip Morris’s estimate is that the retail prices of
cigarettes will rise in nominal terms by an absolute minimum of
$1.20/pack by 2002 and $1.52/pack by 2007, reflecting increases
of 66% and 84% respectively over present average prices.

In real terms, i.e., expressed in 1997 dollars, the retail
price increases will be a minimum of $1.06/pack in 2002 and
$1.19/pack in 2007, reflecting increases of 58% and 65%

respectively.
