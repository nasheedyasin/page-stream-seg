Experimental Procedure

Material and procedures used in this experiment were the same as reported
in Hsieh, File Note dated March 28, 1980, except the following:

The column temperature in preparative gas chromatography was maintained
at 80°C for 7 minutes, then programmed at 4°C/min. to 230°C. Two such
runs were cartied out to obtain a larger amount of ¢.

one injection to acquire better signal-to-no

spectrometry.

The column temperature in fused silica capillary GC/MS was maintained
at 40°C for 10 minutes, then programmed at 2°C/min. to c, and then
programmed at 6°C/min. to cleanup the columa. Electron impact mode of
mass spectrouetry was used for identification. ~
