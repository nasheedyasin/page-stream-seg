On July 1, 1992, you provided Brown & Williamson a listing to indicate
which brands of B&W owned trademarks were being produced by BAT Hong
Kong with non-caution labels. I now would appreciate your assistance

in regards to the following clarifications.

Does BAT Hong Kong manufacture AMERICAN CLUB KS, AMERICAN CLUB 100,
HILTON Lights KS Box, HILTON Super Longs Box with non-caution labels?

Your prompt reply to this inquiry will be most appreciated.

With kind regards,
