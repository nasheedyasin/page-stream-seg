For reporting purposes, we would like for the results from each panel to be cate-
gorized as follows:

All Smokers

Sex
Age Brackets - Less than 45 and 45 and over

As usual, we would like for your report to include a copy of the transmittal letter,
questionnaire sent to the panelists, and a copy of the questionnaire that your phone

interviewers use for callbacks.
