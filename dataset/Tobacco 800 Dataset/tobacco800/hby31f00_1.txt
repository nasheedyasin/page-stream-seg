Dear Jerry:

This is to confirm the parameters of the GEMINI filter that we
recently discussed over the phone. A liet of parameters and filter
schematic are attached. The design is for a filter with 50%
ventilation and with 15% of the smoke traveling through the tubing.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. My office phone
number is (502) 568-7802.

Sincerely,

Kelly St. Chace
