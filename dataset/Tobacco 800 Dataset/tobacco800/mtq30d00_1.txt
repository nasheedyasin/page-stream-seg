Re: Proposed Allocations Based on Market Capitalization and Market Share
Gentlemen:

Further to our July 18, 1997 meeting and the various discussions that have been held
since then, we are seeking herewith final agreement on the allocation of future payments
pertaining to the proposed legislative resolution affecting the U.S. tobacco industry and
related settlements, such as the recent one concluded with Florida.

[tis hereby proposed that the $10 billion up-front payment be allocated according to the
average market capitalization of the individual companies over the May 16, 1997 to
September 3, 1997 period,

This period is deemed of sufficient length to iron out any potential distortions that could
affect individual companies, whilst also being responsive to RIR's request to avoid the
Specific period during which its stock price was the subject of speculative maneuvers.
The May 16, 1997 date reflects the day agreement in principle was reached on the use of
market capitalization for the purpose of allocating the up-front payment. The proposed
period yields the following allocation:

Philip Morris USA
Brown & Williamson
Lorillard

R.J, Reynolds Tobacco
UST

SEPP 9L9TS
