Mr. J. C. Whitaker:
TUNG TREE LEAVES

Tung tree leaves submitted by R. E. Bergren were treated
three different ways before making into cigarettes. One part was used â€”
green, one was dried by artificial heet and the third allowed to dry
by hanging in the shade.

The smoke from the leaves possessed the sare odor and teste
independent of the way of drying. \

The dried leaves were blended with cigarette tobacco in
the proportion of 1%, 3%, and 5%. Cigardttes made from these blends
have a decidely unpleasant odor and taste:reminding one of burning
urine. The tung leaves are not suitable for use in a cigarette
designed to give pleasure in smoking.

We have no information in our files regardine the medicinal
properties of the smoke of tung leaves.
