MEMORANDUM TO THE LEAF AND BLENDS COMMITTEE

In the absence of the Chairman, Mr. Stokes discussed with
members of the Committee the following:

* All of our brands except TEMPO are currently
using the G-13 product. When K-13 was adopted,
the volume of TEMPO was not large enough to
make the use of K-13 economical. C-13 is now
being used in CAMEL Filter and is a blend
common to all brands. It is recommended that
C-13 also be adopted for use in TEMPO.

The Committee approved the above recommendation to become
effective June 28, 1971.
