President

Dear Mr. Cleary:

RE: Trademark MARLBORO Red Roof and Design and
Infringement on "Racing Car Bedspread"

We have noted the use of the MARLBORO Red Roof
Design on the subject "Racing Car Bedspread", advertised by
your company, as shown by the attached photocopy.

The bedspread uses the MARLBORO Red Roof trademark and
tradedress in conjunction with the word Moracar, with a '
capital M so that the bedspread appears much like the tradedress
of our MARLBORO cigarette packages and is a clear copy of the
MARLBORO McLaren Formula One Grand prix racing car.

AS you may be aware, MARLBORO is the world's leading
cigarette and the Red Roof Design is one of the most famous of
all American trademarks. Moreover, while cigarettes are our
major product, substantial business is done in several areas and,
as you may also be aware, MARLBORO sponsors several race cars and
racing teams around the world, including the World Champion
Marlboro-McLaren Racing Team and the current CART-INDY car
Champion.

MARLBORO, the MARLBORO Red Roof Design and the combination
thereof are all trademarks owned by Philip Morris. Accordingly,
the usage of our trademarks, tradedress and words and designs
confusingly similar therewith infringe our rights under federal,
state and common law.
