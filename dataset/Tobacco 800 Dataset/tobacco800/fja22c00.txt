Dear Senator Feinstein:

I am writing in response to your letter regarding the study
commissioned by the Czech affiliate of Philip Morris
International.

The funding and release of this study which, among other
things, detailed the cost savings to the Czech Republic duc to
premature deaths of smokers, exhibited terrible judgment as
well as a complete and unacceptable disregard of basic human
values.

For one of our tobacce companies to cammissien this study was
not just a terrible mistake, it was wrong. All of us at Philip
Morris, no matter where we work, are extremely sorry for this.
No one benefits from the very real, serious and significant
diseases caused by smoking.

lunderstand the outrage expressed in your letter and, I sincerely
regret this extraordinarily unfortunate incident.

Very truly-yours,

Ley Pts
