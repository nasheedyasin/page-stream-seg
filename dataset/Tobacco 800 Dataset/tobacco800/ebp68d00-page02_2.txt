Recommendation (Cont'd.)

Rationale

@ Exceeded the first action standard by achieving superiority
among the franchise. Importantly, it also achievedâ€™ superi-
ority among females and older smokers.

Achieved high absolute ratings among total female competi-
tive smokers, the second action standard. Additionally,

Candidate C achieved parity among males whereas Candidate B
lost.

Tar level of Candidate C at 4.9 mg. versus 5.2 mg. for
Candidate B provides greater flexibility to assure that the
5.0 mg. tar level declared in advertising will be maintained.

Tar level of Candidate C provides the opportunity for future
advertising to declare a uniform tar level of 5 mg. for both
styles as the recommended 100mm product is at a 4.5 mg. tar

level.

Summary

Candidate C is recommended as the 85mm style for national intro-
duction.

Final product test results on both styles will be available by

5/30.
