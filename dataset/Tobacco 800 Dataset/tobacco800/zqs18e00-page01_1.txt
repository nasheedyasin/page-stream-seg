Dear Willy,

you enclosed our standard method for dilution

I am also sending: you part of a study made by Mr. Toimil, of our’ new
brand: development department, showing smoke yield reduction with
porous and zone perforated tippings. As you will notice, there is.

a considerable difference in smoke reduction between both types ~
of tipping paper. This: may. be explained by the fact that the dilu-
tiion measured does not correspond to the dilution.obtained on |
smoking machines. "

This study. has been made with approximately ten dilution ‘levels.
for both types of tipping paper and we still have some: of the
cigarettes. Should! you be: interested, I could send you: some ciga~
rettes used for this study and you could then check your results

with. ours.

I hope: that this! information will be of interest. to you. Please,
contact me if you want the cigarettes.

in

With. my best regards. Hi
