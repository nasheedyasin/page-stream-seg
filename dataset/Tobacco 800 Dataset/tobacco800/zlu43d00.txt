To: Mr. L. C. Cook ; From: R, D. Gourley

In response to Mr. C. N. Pitzer's request to you, the following
information was assembled for VANTAGE type test cigarettes recently shipped
to Mr. E. G. Charnaud at El Progreso, Ecuador.

1. VANTAGE Blend (L-9870A) Ecusta 853 paper
2. CAMEL Filter Blend (L-9870B) Ecusta 856 paper

As indicated by the attached memo from Mr. Ken Swicegood, there is a
difference in top-dressing formulas for our domestic brands, and those
presently utilized by El Progreso for WINSTON CPB, and CAMEL FILTER.
There is also a difference between the R.J.R. cased, blended strips now
being shipped to Ecuador, and domestic CAMEL FILTER blend used in product
B.

Therefore, prior to launching if test results for product B are

favorable arrangements should be made for supplying El Progreso with the
new blend and tep-dressing formula.
