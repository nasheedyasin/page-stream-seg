Dear Charlie:

Attached are data for the polypropylene filter rods you sent, as well
as for cellulose acetate control rods. DD is the deformed diameter of
the rod wien compressed using a weight of 300g over a l2mm wide foot
Hardness is the difference in uncompressed and compressed diameter.
The smaller the number, the harder the rod.

I have also included a piece of latex tubing you can use to construct a
holder for pressure drop measurements. A sketch is attached. You
should be able to obtain more tubing from a medical supply house. If
not, let me know.

Sincerely,

Shabby

F. K.@t. Charles
