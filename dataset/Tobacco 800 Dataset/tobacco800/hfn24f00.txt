Dear Mr. Frankel:

Unfortunately, your March 27 news Teport on a study by
California researchers wao claim to have found that. environ-
mental tobacco smoke. is mful to the health of nonsmokers,
overlooked the caveats raised by Dr. Claude Lenfant of the
National Institutes of Health, whose editorial -- which your
story otherwise quoted extensivel accompanied the study *
in the New England Journal c= Medicine. The same was true

of your April Z editorial, “Thy Neighbor's Lungs."

Dr. Lenfant wrote: "Generally speaking, the evidence that
passive smoking in a general enviyoament has health effects
remains sparse, incomplete and sometimes unconvincing."
went on to point out that "there is no proof as yet that the
reported reduction in airways function has any p. iological
or clinical consequences. The study is confined to only one
aspect of an issue too complex to be resolved on such a
limited basis.

The conclusions teached by Drs. White and Froeb also are at odds
with the latest judgment of the U. S. Surgeon General. His 1979
Report on Smoking and Health, which addressed this issue, found:
“Healthy nonsmokers exposed to cigarette smoke have little or no
physiologic response to the smoke, and what Tesponse does occur
may be due to psychological factors."

Clearly, the California study, which will now be subject to
objective and critical review within the scientific community,
Should not be considered the "final word." For the Times to
advecate public policy which would dictate social behavior and
discriminate against over a third of the adult population on the
basis of this study, seems highly premature and totally out-of

character.
