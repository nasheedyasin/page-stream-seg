Dear Doug:

This will recap the several issues we've discussed regarding an AMERICAN
advertising teat:

I) Background

We have at thie point received Management's conceptual
approval of the "humorous animal" ad series. The
speculative comps used in the presentation are not to be
considered the final creative submissiona on this theme.

A great many issues remain to be resolved by LCF&L and
ATCo.

Strategic Isevea

How can we make this a proprietarily AMERICAN program.
With enough spending there could Just as well be the
Doral or Viceroy "funny animale”. How do we make them
solely/clearly ours? (eg: Is there a "Great American/
Proud American" connection?)

Is the cigarette in the mouth a critical element? Can
we/shovld go ahead with this creative if, for whatever
reason, the cigarette lea ruled out? Should we conduct
preliminary consumer research to test reaction to this
type of visual (as well as the campaign in general)?

wae
Where do you see this campaign going? Can it build/drive
a significant Brand imagery and point of difference?
