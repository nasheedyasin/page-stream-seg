This fs in reference to the additional analytica? work conducted by Dr. Ed

the final invoice.

I understand that Dr. Hahn's draft report met with your approval, and that
we have since mailed you the final version. I trust that this brings the pro-
Ject to a satisfactory conclusion from your viewpoint.

The expense incurred by the additional study, over and abave the ceiling
figure of $13,500 previously authorized by Brawn and killiamson (since the
start of the project), was $1,700. This br ngs the total expenditure on the
Project to $15,200.

Please confirm your authorization of the additional expenditure by sigring
this letter in the space provided below and returning it to Mr. T. A. Dekker,
Administrative Supervisor, IITRI.
