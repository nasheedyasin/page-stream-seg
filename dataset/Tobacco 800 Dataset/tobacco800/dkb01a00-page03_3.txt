ka such smoke really functions in humans as a direct chemical
carcinogen. lence we have not felt that major efforts to reduce
further the infinitesimal levels of polynuclear hydrocarbons in smoke
wi likely to be productive of any rea) benefits. If others, however,
wish to try removing, diminishing or neutralizing the possi! effects
of such substences on the basis of what they believe to he justifiable
assumptions, and provided that any modifications proposed can be show
clearly to produce no other change potentielly deleterious to health,
we could not disapprove. At present the limitations of our bioassa:
methods make such assurance difficult. We could give other illustrations
in addition to this discussion of possible carcinogenicity, such, for
ample @§ Ciliostesis, but the goncral perspective is much the same,
You will be able to apply the general statements thet we have
made, to the eases of the componen suggested in your list as
candidates for analytical study in tobacco leaf sampl We would

In the syecial ca é c tobacco, we
have felt that these were g y any. relation to th

are used in Britain where the incidence of diseases held to be
relatca statistically to cigarette smoking is, nevertheless, much
higher then in the United States.

The Council will be gled to be kept in touch with the program
of the U, &. Department of Agriculture and the National Cancer Institute
and by personal contact. In:tu
furnish those agencies with any desired data or information from our own
program either now or in the futur
