Dirks B. Foster, Esq.

WUNFIDENTIAL

Further modification of the depiction of a racing car
on the back panel of the cabinet, (view 4 on the Deluxe
Type instruction sheet) as we discussed, i.e. either
affixing a decal so as to completely cover up the
depiction of the racing car bearing the Roof Device,
and which would obviate the need for decals 7 and 8, or
affix a decal at the apex of the Roof Device on the
"hood" of the racing car in front of the cockpit;

Confirmation that the screen appearing above the panel
mentioned in paragraph 3 above contains no MARLBORO or
Roof Design images.

I would appreciate your confirming that we are in accord on

all of the foregoing points, and that you will be sending a
comprehensive settlement agreement to me.

Sincerel
