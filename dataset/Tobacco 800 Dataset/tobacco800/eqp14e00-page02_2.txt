My recent appointment here as. world-wide
Marketing Director of Philip Morris
Incorporated includes a marketing responsi-
bility for all our operating companies in the
cigarette, beverages, land development and
industrial endeavors. Since we are active in
more than 170: countries and territories, it is
obvious that my travel demands will be even
greater than in the past.

I am sure you can understand why I will make
every effort in these future trips to not
place myself at the mercy of Pan American.

Sincerely yours,

omeenrn
