RE: Harley-Davidson Cigarettes
Dear Mr. Bluestein:

By the way of this letter I would like to introduce myself and bring
you up-to-date on Harley-Davidson cigarette marketing activities at
Lorillard.

I am the newest member of the Harley-Davidson marketing team and share
responsibility along with Andy Pasheluk and Victor Lindsley in
developing Harley-Davidson cigarettes. Currently, we are proposing to
test Harley-Davidson cigarettes in three new markets - Portland,
Oregon; Eugene, Oregon and, the state of Arkansas. We also plan to
re-introduce Harley-Davidson into Indiana with a new marketing
strategy.

We have developed a new Full-Flavored product along with a Lights
product. Both these products will be tested in all markets. In
addition, we will be offering Harley-Davidson cigarettes at different
price points. In Portland and Eugene, Harley-Davidson will be sold at
full price (as tested previously in Indiana) and in Indiana and
Arkansas, Harley-Davidson will be sold at a reduced or "generic"
price.

In accordance with our contract with you, I have enclosed one set of
full size and one set of reduced size reproductions of point-of-sale
piece mechanicals we are producing for these tests. In addition, If
have enclosed reproductions of our advertising material.
