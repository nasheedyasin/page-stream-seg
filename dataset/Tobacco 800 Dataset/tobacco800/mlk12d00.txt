Dear Alan:

Alan, for upcoming mailings, let’s keep in mind the results of the Misty Trial #5 Nixie
Analysis. We agreed to the following:

@ Not mail either possible nixies or non-standardized addresses and increase our mail
quantity (if possible).

or

® Mail just non-standardized addresses but not possible nixies. This still gives us a slight
lift in response rate and we only lose about 6.3% of our responses.

In addition, let’s consider assigning more than one mail code to a mailing where we are
testing a lot of lists. This way we can track nixie rate by list segment which can provide
some valuable information. We can discuss this as we get into pulling lists for a mailing.

Let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you.

Sincerely,

Meleisa L. Holek
