Dr. R.C,. “Ah ra December 5, 1972.

———“Of the Friday sessions I was particularly impressed with Jim Travis'
“Gpproach to protein chemistry and the utilization of his meticulous techitiques
for the investigation of proteolytic enzymes, Here is a built in quality control
for any experiments your other grantees may conduct in this difficult field.

The work he is doing is basic and of high quality.

In the final paper, Shirley Kaufman demonstrated once again her sound
grasp of the cytodynamics of the lung, She has developed a reliable and repro-
ducible model for cellular quantitation; now she has to decide what definitive |
experiments can be built around this precise model.

These. are hurried and somewhat extemporaneous comments but if I don't
write them down and mail them to you today, chances are that you'll never have
any comments at all!

Once again, my thanks to you and your staff for a delightful and thought
provoking meeting, It is hard to document the benefits that accrue from personal

interchanges during such a small meeting, but I'm certainly glad I came,

With best wishes.

Yours sincerely,—-,
