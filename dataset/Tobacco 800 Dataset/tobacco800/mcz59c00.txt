Dear Doctor Gardner:

Tam writing this letter to accompany a grant application by Dr. Bruce Woda that

he is submitting to The Council for Tobacco Research. The application is entitled
"Cell Surface Membranes, Integral Membrane Proteins and Cytoskeleton in Lympho-
cytes from Young and Old Rats," and is concerned with some fundamental problems
in antigen recognition and tumor surveillance.

The Council for Tobacco Research allows a 15 percent overhead on all its grants

that are awarded. If the Council shall consider Dr. Woda's grant favorably and make
an award, neither this institution nor he would be able to accept it, because of the
small 15 percent overhead. The overhead at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation
for 1979 has been calculated at 40.5 percent. This is a relatively low figure for an
academic institution and certainly for a commercial institution. The policy of our
institution is that all overhead must be paid since we are a non-profit, private organi-
zation and do not have the means to take up the difference between the allowed over-
head and the real overhead. Certainly, Dr. Woda does not have 25 percent of his
request, approximately $15,000, to pay this difference. I would appreciate that if
this grant finds favor with The Council for Tobacco Research and is awarded some
means may be found to reimburse Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation for the
difference between your allowed overhead and the actual overhead, or approximately
25 percent additional.

Iam submitting this letter with this application so that it can be presented to the
Council as a formal request for consideration.

Sincerely yours,
fbwan
