Dear Mr. Bradlee:

In the Post's November 24 article, “Increased Limit-
ations Urged on 'Pushing' Use of Tobacco," Dr. William
Pollin of the National Institute of Drug Abuse asserted
tobacco is “a powerfully addictive drug." It is clear
that this was a political statement and that Dr. Pollin's
intent is to create a public impression that cigarette
smoking is somehow similar to hard drug use.

The "addiction" label is taxed, however, when the
Surgeon General reports that 33 million Americans have
given up smoking, and 95 percent of them have done so
on their own and without outside help.

The term "addiction" is misused regularly these days
and consequently has lost its true scientific meaning.
The Surgeon General, for example, has even claimed
that youngsters can become "addicted" to video games.

The scientific literature clearly shows there is an
ongoing curiosity among scientists about the reasons
why people smoke. It seems apparent that the decision-
making processes involved in whether, when and where

an individual smokes are highly complex and, as yet,
little understood. Some scientists have termed smoking
an "overlearned" behavior, similar in many ways to
drinking coffee.

In short, cigarette smoking should not be termed an

addiction.
