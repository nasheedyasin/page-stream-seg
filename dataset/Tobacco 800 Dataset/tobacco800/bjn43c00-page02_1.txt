If ties existed, they were ranked using standard deviations, and if still tied, alphabetically. All

reported data, which has already been rounded once, then values may occasionally be different from
those listed in the “Rounded Test Results” section,

Included are TITL files on a 1.4Mb, 35-inch disk, readable on an IBM compatible computer. Two
unique files are stored on the disk in three different formats. One file contains TPM, Water, and Puff
