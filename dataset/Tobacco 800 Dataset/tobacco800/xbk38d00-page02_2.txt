While this action reflected the needs of the time it has resulted in poor
standardisation of equipment. Additionally, much of the equipment converted
was low speed Molins units purchased as reconditioned stock from Richmond

in the late sixties.

These two proposals to a major degree allow for the correction of the
problems identified above and in our view should ensure competitive
productivity and product quality for the foreseeable future.

You should note that the Australian tobacco company already has approval

to spend U.S.$2.806 million for New Primary weighbelts, dryers and cylinders.
This amount is additional to the new request attached and the equipment
authorised under the earlier capital appropriation has been fully integrated
into the layouts shown in the new proposal. .

Finally, as part of the total facilities development review we also assessed
the feasibility of building a totally new factory in a different location.
Apart from the fact that the cost of $60 million plus was not seen as
commercially prudent, the attendent industrial ramifications were assessed
at such proportions as to make such a venture virtually unattainable.

We have carefully checked the proposals with T.T.G. personnel and where
appropriate with original equipment manufacturers. I am satisfied that
the proposals attached represent reasonable long term upgrade plans that
are achievable with the resources identified. I therefore submit these
recommendations for your consideration and respectfully request your
approval to seek Philip Morris Board approval for the capital identified.

Kind regards,

Geoff Bible
