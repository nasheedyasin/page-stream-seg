Dear Dr Gienn

Thank you for your (elefaxed letter of 30 October 1990. 1 am most
grateful to you and to Dr Lynch for your deliberations in this matter. I can
assure you that the sum of $57,741 will be instrumental in carrying
forward our debrisoquine projects until June 1991.

It is eminently possible that, in addition to studies with Dr Lynch and
with the USC group, we shall now be able to collaborate with a Norwegian
group who have bloods from 220 lung cancer cases and 220 controls and,
in addition, take parl in a multicentre study with Curt Harris's laboratory
at NCI, a follow-up to the Caporaso et al. paper published in JNCI in
August last.

Thank you once agai.

With warmest regards.

Yours sincerely

Jack —
