Reference: Grant No. 1406
Dear Bob;

I am writing to the Council for Tobacco Research to thank them for the
grant for the subject entitled "Effects of Aging and Lipids on the Immune
System". This award will certainly help two young investigators continue
with some interesting investigations on some problems of aging at a molecular
level. I understand that the overhead required by Scripps Clinic and |
Research Foundation will be adjudicated betw√©en Dr. Sommers and Br. Dixon.

Many thanks and the Council for Tobacco Research will certainly be
acknowledged for its grant support in any future publications,

Sincerely,

: iA
