Dear Ms, Bodi:

Per our conversation of October 15, 1980, this is your
authorization to conduct a product test for Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corporation for $2,550 (rebid) using
200 smokers (1/2 male/1/2 female) equally divided among
full-taste smokers and mainstream hi-fi smokers (see
attached list of valid smokers).

In screening for smokers their "most often brand" must
be from the attached list.

Respondents must be 21 or older and not pe concentrated
in any age group.

Questionnaire and product will be supplied by us.
Questions to be asked are preference, strength, and
taste/flavor.

The study should be conducted by having respondents come
in and pick up their cigarette and a questionnaire, and
after 3-4 days you would call them back for their
responses.

You will provide us with the completed tally sheets
showing responses in totals by smoker group and by sex
within smoker groups. There should also be breaks by
age within groups.
