IMPROVEMENT ON CAR RMINATION/456

SUMMA)

A chromatographic improvement has been made on a BAT-Hamburg procedure
for the determination of tobacco carotenoid. Much better
chromatographic resolution and a 25% saving in analysis time have been
achieved. This is part of an effort to set up an in-house method for
carotenoid determination.

INTRODUCTION

Many important tobacco flavor components have been found to be derived
from carotenoids.!-2 However, studies?4 also indicated that

tobacco carotenoid content reached a maximum at maturity and decreased
drastically during curing and further processing. Workers have been
intereated in the determination of:

1. Ways of breeding and cultivating to increase tobacco
carotenoid content.

Proper harvest time and practices to maximize tobacco
carotenoid concentration.

Optimal processing and storage conditions to maintain
carotenoid content in tobaccos.

Physical, chemical, or biological conditions far controlled
degradation of carotenoids, which would lead to desirable
flavors.

5. Ways to incorporate carotenoid flavors to achieve desirable
smoking properties.

An in-house method for carotenoid determination can certainly
facilitate the above-mentioned activities.
