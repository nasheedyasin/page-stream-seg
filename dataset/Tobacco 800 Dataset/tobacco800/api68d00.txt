G-7 - Use of Concentrated G-7 Extract

The aeration-evaporator used to supply 24-25 per cent solid content extract
at the wet end sprays of No. 4 Dryer was continued all week with a 310-315
ft./min. dryer speed without difficulty.

After arrangements had been made to store 500 gallons of concentrated
extract at the product end of No. 4 Dryer, a 2.3 hr. run was made on June 15
with concentrated extract applied to sprays at both ends of No. 4 Dryer. The
extract used at the feed end was about 5-6 per cent stronger and that at the
product end about 2 per cent stronger than that normally used. With these
strengths the dryer speed was increased to 340 ft./min. from its normal 280-290
ft./min. and a sheet of satisfactory flavor and moisture content was made.

No operating difficulties were experienced. One 600-lb. can of diced product
from No. 4 Dryer was separated and saved to determine if the test product
tended to laminate. The can saved from the test run when using concentrated
extract only on the product end last week was too dry, about 11.5% moisture,
to prove if using the concentrated extract in this manner would cause
lamination.
