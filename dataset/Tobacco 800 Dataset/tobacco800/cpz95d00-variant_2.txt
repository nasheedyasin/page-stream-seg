2. Hyperphosphorylation of the src kinase hck induced by FcyRI engagement

To assay for sre kinase activation following FeyRI engagement, we used a panel
of rabbit anti-peptide antisera generated in our laboratory that react specifically with
different src family protein tyrosine kinases, including heck, fer, lyn, and sre, all of which
are expressed in monocytes. We made use of a sensitive in-situ kinase assay to detect
autophosphorylation of src PTK, which accompanies their activation. THP-1 cells were
stimulated with anti-FcyRI mAb 197, then permeabilized with o-lysophosphatidylcholine
and incubated on ice in the presence of 32P-y-ATP. Cells were then subjected to detergent
lysis and immunoprecipitation with the different anti-sre antisera. As shown in Figure 2,
we detected an increase in phosphorylation in kek in THP-1 cells within 30 seconds of
stimulation by anti-FcyRI mAb. In contrast, we did not detect increases in
phosphorylation of other src PTK (not shown). These results suggest that activation of
the PTK kek is coupled to FeyRI engagement. We are currently evaluating the physical
association of src kinases with FeyRI. Our preliminary data suggest that hck and lyn are
present in anti-FeyRI immunoprecipitates from THP-1 cells and peripheral blood
monocytes, as detected by immunoblotting.

engagement in THP-1 cells, In situ kinase assay was performed as described in text. Anti-hck
immunoprecipitates from lysates of cells stimulated for between 0-5 minutes (as indicated) were
analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. M.W. markers (right hand lane) are at 92, 69 and
46 kDa. Four other experiments gave similar results.

I trust that this information will be helpful to the reviewers of the application.
