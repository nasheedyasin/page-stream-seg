Dear Lorraine,

I enclose my expense account in relation to the September SAB mecting and the
Johns Hopkins’ site visit. As I understand it, CTR had agreed that, because of both
the Labor Day holiday and the site visit, we should fly in on Sunday 6 September
and depart Saturday 12 September. We did in fact arrive one day sooner and, in
order to compensate, departed’ immediately after the SAB meeting on Friday 11
September. Accordingly my expense account covers that complete period and I trust
you will find it in order. :

I have attached all possible receipts and have not included meals taken outside the
hotels, including one where I entertained Dr. Gonzalez from NCI in order to quiz
him about the application from Dr. Quattrochi. I am a little uncertain as to the
guidelines for expenses and would be grateful for your future guidance.

I hope all is well with Mr. Gertenbach and all his Staff and let me thank you all for
your kindness and hospitality.

In order to expedite matters, would you please call me if you have any queries or
problems associated with making the reimbursement directly to my Citibank
account.

With warmest best wishes,

Yours sincerely,

Jet, (ye
