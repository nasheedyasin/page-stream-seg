Dear Al,

Enclosed are two copies of the Harley-Davidson/Lorillard agreement which incorporates
all the changes we have agreed to. I've signed both documents. Please fill in the

appropriate date on pages | and 4, sign both documents and return one fully executed
document with a check for $250,000 tome.

I would appreciate it if you could have the completed document back to me by

March 2] at the latest. March 21 is the end of our fiscal First Quarter and we are
already one month past our (I thought conservative!) target date for a signed
agreement, and three months past the date we had a "handshake" agreement.

I look forward to a mutually beneficial relationship.
Very truly yours,

Qe axa
