Dear. George:

This letter is to confirm youw conversation with T. A. Vollmuth on
October 1, 1986 in which we gave verbal authorization to cancel
scheduled testing on material B207 which was submitted on Septem-
ber 23, 1986 for the 14-Day Subacute Toxicity Study in Rats and
the Multi-dose Rangefinder in Rats.

Test material A177, Hazleton project number 642-365, which was
lethal in the 14-Day study when 80% propylene glycol was used as
the vehicle, will be retested in place of B207 for the 14-day
study only.

Also, we are submitting an additional sample of B198 in order to
complete the multi-dose phase of the rangefinder study.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.
