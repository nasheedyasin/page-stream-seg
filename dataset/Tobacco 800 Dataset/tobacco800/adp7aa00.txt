Dr. Robert C. Hockett

Associate Scientific Director
' Tobacco Industry Research Committee
150 East Forty Second Street .

New York 17, New York :

Dear Dr. Hockeitt:

Please find enclosed a formalized proposal which represents the core of:the
larger proposal, also enclosed.

If you (TIRC) are truly interested in an integrated program from the oral cavity
to the blood stream, I suggest that the larger proposal be considered. From
our point of view it represents a great deal of effort with the highest probability
of making a concrete contribution to the uniqueness. of the cigarette smoking
phenomenon. â€”

Any efforts that you can make to focus your Advisory Board's cooperation in
this direction will be appreciated.

It appears to:tne that yotrand Dr. Little are in an advantageous position to work
with N.C.I. on recommendationsand cooperative undertakings. With Dr. Kotin
on your board an ideal liason could be effected with N.C.I. and other groups in
N.1,H. who are concerned with these problems.

In terms of capability we have the confidence that we are in a better position
than most to tool up and redirect our efforts without sacrificing existing programs.

Very Peeey yours,

We lel LA
