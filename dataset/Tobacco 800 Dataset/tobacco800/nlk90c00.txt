Dear Mr. Nixon:

Patti Hirst, Key Accounts Manager for American Tobacco, asked me to forward some printed
samples of our Montclair Chain Direct Mail Program to you. Enclosed are samples from
another program that we did recently for you to distribute to your retail store locations. We
are expecting to be in the mail with the Dahl's Foods direct mail package late next week.
Any questions, please contact Patti Hirst.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Meleisa Holek
Manager, Direct Marketing
