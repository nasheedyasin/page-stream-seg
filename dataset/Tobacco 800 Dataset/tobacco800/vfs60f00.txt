Re-evaluation of Modi
Cigarectes Supplied by
Chemical Industries, Inc.

This wenorandum is a scpplement and/or a correction to a memorandua dated
February 24, 1964 fron Dr. J. G. Esterle to BR, A. Brown, In this prewicus
ancitacive data were given for normal Lark cigarettes where
Darco KCF carbon had been subscttuted for che Lark sarbon. It was reporced
het the modified Lark's conaiaed 61 mg of Darco RCP carbon which showed
devacicn equivalent to the Lark carbon.

4 evaluation of these mud ified Lark cigarectes shows that only 42 mg vf the
Darco KCF carben was packed into the cavity of Lark filter (the carbon
has a lower bwik density than the Lark carbon and the 42 ag is the max:cus
loading). 4 second sample of the modified Lark arectes (reveived 3/18/64)
showed an average of 41 mg cf KCP carben per cigarette.

daca reported previously are actually data on Lark cigarettes supplied by
mapared to Lark purchased by B&W. Ie was erroneously assumed that ihe
Lark cigarettes consisted of a qa te pack when in Fact it was

found on examining the concents of che pack that tes had becn
acdified while the reaainder consisted of 1

The £. llowing data were obtained on the mudified Lark
3/18/64 and ave coupared w.th the data previously reported for the Lerk cigarette
and tcbacco section.

lc can be seen from che data tha: the KCF carben ts not superior co the Lark carbon
althi t vedect{oas are obtained, low bulk deusicy vf the caéfbon,
however, vould be a liability in cbtafning a h ghec loading which would cncrease
{shiration. It ia felt tbat che 41-42 sy loading is the maxiuua for the volume
