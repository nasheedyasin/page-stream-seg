Mr. Alan Sherman April 6, 1993

Please provide these counts by Thursday, 4/8. Let me know if we are going to incur
any costs above the $7,000 we have budgeted for list pulls. We do not want to wait
for the update to produce these counts since we will probabiy not add many additional
PALL MALL names.

Agy questions, please let me know.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

(eteron Motel
