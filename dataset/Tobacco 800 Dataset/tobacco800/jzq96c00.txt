Registration for meetings $12.00
Transpor&ation to and from train
terminal 50 miles at 10 cents/mile 5.00
Round trip railroad fare 13.00
Hotel for April 8th and 9th 39.22
Taxi, phone, tips, etc. 4.00
Meals 20.75
$93.97

Attached are the necessary receipts for tax purposes. Also is
enclosed a copy of the program for April 28th.

! have sent Dr. Goldenberg a copy of the program, the Moloney
virus concentration procedure and the procedure for grinding tissues
for CF testing. He will send his samples to me In the future and
| will see that they are tested and the results returned to him.
This will relieve Dr. Huebner of this responsibility and | will keep
him informed of such testing since it will have to be done in his
laboratory at least for some months.

Sincerely yours,
