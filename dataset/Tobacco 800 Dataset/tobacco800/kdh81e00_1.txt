Dear Mr. Judge:

You'll find the attached letter from Ray Cave, TIME's
managing editor, of interest. While Cave's defense
of the magazine's coverage of the recent surgeon
general's report is. unsatisfactory -- he'd probably
even admit it's awkward -- we did seem to get his
attention.

Cordially,

Sa,

William D. Tooheyy
