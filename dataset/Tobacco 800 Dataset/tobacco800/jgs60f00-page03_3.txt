tified constituent (tentatively identified as di-butyl phthalate)
preseat in the complaint sample was also fonnd in notmal KOOL production samples, it was
felt necessary to obtat o ositive identification ané to determine its source. A
obtained fram the factory and analyzed chromatographically.
found in the tipping adhesives and collected for a more positive
identification 2 data ide d the material as a di-butyl phthalate.
Mr. James Hume of i actment contacted the supplier and they said that
isobutyl phthalate is a t of the tipping adhesives.

Table IXI is a listing of the raw materials which were investigated for di~butyl phthalate
content.

It can be seen that the two tipping adhesives and the llophane solvent are the primary
carriers of di-butyl phthalate, The suppliers have assured us that the adhesives and
ceellophane solvent have FDA approval. The toxicity manuals indicate that ‘di-buty]
phthalate’ has a very. low order of toxicity The total information suggests that the
prese of di-butyl phthalate was normal for KOOL cigarettes and should not have been
\3 basis for the registered complaint.
