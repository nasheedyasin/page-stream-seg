RE: Trademark MARLBORO Roof Design and Infringement on
TONKA TURBO TRICKSTERS : *- .

Dear Mr. Andrews:

This is further to and will confirm our telephone
conversation of December 5, 1989, wherein I raised my company's
objection to the manufacture and sales of the subject toy.
Attached is a copy of the advertisement for same in a Toys-R-Us
supplement to the November 29, Washington Post.

The toy car uses the MARLBORO Red Roof trademark and
tradedress in conjunction with the word Monster, with a capital
M, so that the car appears much like the MARLBORO tradedress
shown on the attached photocopy.

As you are no doubt aware, MARLBORO is the world's leading.
cigarette and the Red Roof Design is one of the most famous of
all American trademarks. Moreover, while cigarettes are our
major product, substantial business is done in several areas and,
as you may also be aware, MARLBORO sponsors several race cars and
racing teams around the world, ifficluding.the World Champion
MARLBORO~McLaren racing team and ‘the current CART-Indy Car.
