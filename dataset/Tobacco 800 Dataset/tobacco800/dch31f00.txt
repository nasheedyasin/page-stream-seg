Dear Dr. Hardwick:

I recently read the document TM.84/10/035 “Computer Model to Predict
Cigarette Physical Properties” by N. Boham. We believe that this
program would be very helpful here at Baw.

We would appreciate it if you would send us a program listing and/or a
5 1/4" floppy disk containing the program. It would be ideal if we
could have disks in both APPLE and PET formats, but if this is not
possible the APPLE format is preferred. Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Kelley St. lor
