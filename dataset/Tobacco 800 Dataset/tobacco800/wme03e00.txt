Dear Bill:

Philip Morris has committed to four full-page bleed, 4-color Marlboro
insertions in the 1986 Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter editions of
The Atlantic Salmon Journal.

I do not have closing dates yet, but expect to receive them soon.
When I do, I will forward all pertinent information to you.

Best regards,
