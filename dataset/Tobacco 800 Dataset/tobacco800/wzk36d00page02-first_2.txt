It is improbable that this type of collaborative opportunity will present itself again:
Henry Lynch has a unique resource which I should like to help make "more
permanent". Please do not hesitate to call me at home or the laboratory for any
further clarification of these proposals, It may help you to know that gifts and
donations made to named individuals for purposes of research are zero-rated for
overheads in this institution. Grants however, approved by our Finance Office,
have an indirect cost of 40% added.

With kindest regards,

Yours sincerely,
