To: Committee of Counsel

Gentlemen:

Yesterday morning, April 2, Mr. Kornegay and I
called on Chairman Engman at the Federal Trade Commission.
We had suggested, in making this appointment, that he might
care to have Mr. Rosch present. Not only did Rosch turn
up, but he also had Eric Rubin, who had taken Mr. Meyer's
place, Terrence Boyle, and one of Chairman Engman's assistants
present. 7

Our presentation covered three points. The first
two may be briefly summarized. The third is a most confus-
ing aberration.

1. We mentioned to the Chairman that we had been
originally advised that the Staff report and recommendations
would go forward to the Commission about March 11. We were
told that we could file a statement to accompany that re-
port, but,that Mr. Rosch insisted that we file the industry
statement by March 14. We mentioned that we had learned
that no report had as yet gone forward from the Staff to the
Commission.

After noting that the industry was not in a posi-
tion to tell the Bureau how to operate, we urged two points:
that the Commission review the entire situation in depth and
that we hoped that each Commissioner could at least read
the introduction and our recommendations. We renewed the
request that if the opportunity presented itself that Mr.
Kornegay and Mr. Austern appear at the Commission table to
answer questions or to supplement the Statement.
