Dear Alan:

We have received approval on the 3/94 Triple Brand mailing and need to proceed with the
list pull in order to meet a 3/7/94 tape delivery date.

The mail universe is the same one we mailed for the 1/94 Triple Brand mailing. The final
mail counts are as follows:

© Misty 724,514
@ Montclair 2,285,093
®@ Carlton 983,961
Total 3,993,568
We will need to assign new mail and promotion codes. We are going to assign promotion
codes for this mailing since there is room in the coupon layout for them. The coupon stream
by brand is as follows:

Carlton Montelair and Misty (Separate mailings)

BIGIF $1.00 off/pack or carton
$3.00 off/carton $3.00 offfcarton

“Please provide us with the standard audit reports and include Misty and Carlton inswitcher
model scores for the Misty and Carlton mail universe. The seed list remains the same as the
one used for the previous mailing.
