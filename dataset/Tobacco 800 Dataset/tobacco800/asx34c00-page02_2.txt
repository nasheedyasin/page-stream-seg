represent the actual “cost” or “expense,” and whether the claimed expenditures were made “in
connection with” the instant litigation. Whether or not these materials are themselves the
“subject” of the audit, or may have been originally created pursuant to a separate Icgal obligation
of yours, are facts wholly irrelevant to your firm’s obligation to produce them pursuant to the
New Mexico FPA.

Although we will go forward with the initial visit to your firm by our auditors that
is scheduled to commence on July 13, you should know that your continued refusal to provide
the requested documentation will constitute a material breach of the FPA, and will preclude the
OPMs’ completion of the full audit of your firm’s costs and expenses (the completion of which is
itself a prerequisite to any arbitration of this matter). Accordingly, I urge you to reconsider your
position. In any event, the OPMs reserve all of their rights under the FPA and the Master
Settlement Agreement.

Very truly yours,

Elizabeth C. David, Esq.
