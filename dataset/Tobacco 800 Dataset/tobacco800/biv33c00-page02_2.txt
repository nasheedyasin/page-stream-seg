you cerrectly stated in your Jever, application of the correct volume
adjusunent formula as set forth in the June | Agreement and of the actual year 2000 volume and
intlation data resulted in a credit being due to the Seuling Deiendants from the State of Florida
as of December 31, 2000 in the aggregate principal amount of $17.420.705. Pursuant to the June
} Agreement. interest was added to that principal amount with respect to the period between the
duty the 2600 estimated payment was made and the date of the June 1 Agreement at an annual
rate of 9, the same rate of interest as that paid pursuant to the June | Agreement by the
Settling Defendants to the State of Florida.

tn addition, because only two of the Settling Defendants (Philip Morris and

Lonilard) had payment obligations this year under the June } Agreement, only that portion of the
aggregate principal credit amount that was due to those two Settling Defendants ($12,147,383)
could be apphed i conneetion with the payments made in June 2001 pursuant to the June |
Agreement. The remainder of the aggregate principal credit amount that is stil] duc to the other

ctling Defendants (Brown & Williamson and KJ. Keynolds) ($5,273,322) is carrying
imwrest at an agreed-upon annual rate of 8% from June 1, 2002 to December 31, 2001, and it will
be credited against their respective payments due to the State of Florida on December 31, 2001.

Accordingly, it is the application of interest rates to the principal credit amounts,
us described in the preceding two paragraphs of this letter and embodied in the total credit
amounts set forth in the June | Agreement, ihat accounts for the difference cited in your letter.

Thepe you find that this information answers your question.

Very truly yours,
