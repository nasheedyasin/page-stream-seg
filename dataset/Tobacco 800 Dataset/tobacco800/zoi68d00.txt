G-7 - Use of Concentrated G-7 Extract
ae Oe vOCentrated Ga/ Extract

A 600-1b. can of G-7 diced product made by spraying 5-6 per cent stronger
than normal extract at the wet end of No. 4 dryer and 2 per cent stronger
extract at the product end showed no tendency to laminate after 4 days storage
at 13.1 per cent moisture content. Another run is planned using similar
conditions. ,

The aeration-evaporator was used to concentrate extract for both No. 4
and No. 5 Dryers during most of the week because of extractor press tests at
Bldg. 92-2. This helped to avoid below standard flavors while 92 extract was
weak.

A $125,000 price estimate for the 15,000 1b./hr. evaporator proposed for
the G-7 production increase downtown has been received from Swenson Division.
A six-to seven-month delivery time was quoted. This evaporator would permit
up to a 20 per cent production increase if there were no bottlenecks in the
other plant equipment used to prepare pulp and extract.
