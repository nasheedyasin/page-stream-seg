Re: Agreement Dated June 14, 1993

Dear Mr. Stanner:

In confirmation of our discussions, Motormarketing International of
Cleveland, Inc. (“Motormarketing”), one of the International Management Group of
Companies (“IMG”) failed to fulfill certain of its obligations set forth in the
Agreement dated June 14, 1993 (the "Agreement") between Motormarketing and
Philip Morris Incorporated ("Philip Morris"). As a result, Philip Morris did not
receive sponsorship rights to which it was entitled during the Championship Auto
Racing Teams, Inc./PPG Indy Car Race held at the Burke Lakefront Airport in
Cleveland, Ohio on July 10th and 11th, 1993.

Despite Motormarketing’s failure to perform, Philip Morris has agreed
to pay the total $96,000 sponsorship payment set forth in Paragraph 4 of the
Agreement. In consideration for Philip Morris’ agreement to pay the entire
sponsorship payment, Motormarketing has agreed to provide Philip Morris with
the following sponsorship rights during the 1994 CART/PPG Indy Car World
Series.

1. IMG, through Motormarketing or another IMG
company, will promote the Detroit Grand Prix in Belle Isle Park,
Detroit, Michigan in 1994. In consideration for Philip Morris ‘payment
of no more than $66,000, Motormarketing, on its own behalf and on
behalf of IMG, has agreed to provide Philip Morris the same
sponsorship rights at the 1994 Detroit Grand Prix as those enjoyed by
Philip Morris during the 1993 Detroit Grand Prix; or,
