Mre J. C. Whitaker:

Subject: ARLEX

The Formula Committee consisting of Messrs. Je C.:
Whitaker, J. W. Glenn and R. C. Haberkern, with Messrs,
P. Frank Hanes and E. H. Harwood attending, met in Mr.

P. Frank Hanes! office on October 7, 1947. This group
discussed the advisability of using Arlex as a condition-
ing and softening agent for plug tobacco...

Mr. Whitaker informed the group that the Manufactur-
ing Department has been interested in Arlex for the past
several years but our Purchasing Department could not
obtain this material, The manufacturer (Atlas Powder Co.)
now informs us that due to expanded manufacturing facili-
ties they can supply us up to 200,000 pounds of Arlex per
month.

Mr. Harwood stated that tests made in Chemical Labo-
ratory showed Arlex to be better than Glycerine for condi-
tioning plug tobacco. Arlex was found to be very compati-
ble with plug tobacco. It has a permanent softening effeot
since Arlex is not volatile and does not crystallize. On
the other hand, Glycerine is not permanent as it is some-
what volatile and is less effective for conditioning plug
tobacco. Arilex is a syrup having a bland, sweet taste.

It consists chiefly of d-Sorbitol. d-Sorbitol is a hexa-
hydric alcohol which occurs in nature, being widely dis-.
tributed in fruits and berries, Arlex is made commerciale
ly from glucose.

Mr. Harwood recommended using up to 5% of Arilex on
plug tobacco to replace the Glycerine used. Mr. Glenn sug-
gested that a carload of Arlex be purchased and the change-~
over from Glycerine to Arlex be made gradually. These
recommendations were approved by the Formula Committee and
Mr. Haberkern was instructed to purchase a tank oar of
Arlex,.
