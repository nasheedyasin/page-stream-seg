KENT LIGHTS 100 EGYPT/941

Marcel,
I have received your fax dated December 23,

T have reviewed the requirements for the 135 mm polyprop pack film as
regards to both the KENT LIGHTS and the KENT PARENT products. for Egypt.
Per your suggestion, we will use the material currently in Egypt to
fi11 our immediate KENT LIGHTS 100 pack film requirements.

Future orders of pack and carton film will depend on a combination of
factors such as production volumes of the PARENT product, release of
materials held by our original agent in Egypt, and our ability to
qualify a film source with Egypt. I will advise of our specific needs
as the situation develops.

Thanks for your assistance.

With kind regards,

597001970
