Project 2903

G—7 Use of Concentrated G-7 Extract

Test run TPD-65-1 was run on No. 4 Dryer at 90-3 on May 15, 1973 to prepare
5400 lbs. each of a control lot and a test lot of G~7 using 26 percent solid
content extract on wet end sprays. The control lot was run just ahead of the
test lot, both in No. 4 Dryer using the same feed blend. Fifty pounds of each
of the large lots are being used to prepare 100 percent G-7 test cigarettes for
preliminary evaluation before the large lots are factory tested.
