INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM

Subject: RE: Case 185. Dote: April 16, 1969 .

To: Dr. H. J. Bluhm

Although our strain of A. oxydans has the unusual ability to
tolerate and hydroxylate nicotine, its identifying characteristics
are the same as given for that species in Bergey's Manual. Therefore,
we have referred to the Manual in the text of the application instead
of including the long list of characteristics. This appears to be
common practice in patents already issued. .

Yes, we believe Figures I and II are important in the application.
The amount of inoculum (Figure I) required to obtain a high yield in
a reasonable time is critical and is proportional to the concentration
of nicotine in the medium. A relatively short incubation time (Figure II)
was required to complete the fermentation of various concentrations of

nicotine. The above facts are necessary documentation of the claims.
proposed in this disclosure.

We have written in 4 claims to replace those in the

to us. These claims point out the 4 basés for claiming
which are:

copy returned.
protection

Purification of nicotine to permit fermentation

of concentrations
up to 10%.

Use of a specific strain of A. oxydans..

Yields up to 93.9% after incubation for less than 72 hours.

4. The use of a non-sterile nicotine containing medium without danger

of contamination.

Claims

1 and 3 could be separated into two each as follows, if desirable, ©

(1) a. Purification of nicotine to permit its fermentation in.
concentrations in excess of 0.05%.

b. Fermentation of concentrations of nicotine in excess 0.5%

and as great as 10%.
