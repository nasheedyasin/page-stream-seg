February 13, 1980

For "out-of-home" and "point-of-sale" advertisements, you may use
either the new or old FTC test results if the advertisement or materials
are delivered in final form to the printer or are painted or assembled on
or before February 21, 1980. Delivery of such advertisements after

this date necessitates use of the new test results. As before, the T/N
values are not required on "point-of-sale" materials which are reasonably
expected to be exposed to the public beyond a six-month period.

The T/N legend must be in a color, including black or white, clearly
contrasting with the color of the background. In so-called "bleed"
advertisements, or those having a multicolored background, a solid and
distinctly contrasting background should be used behind the legend.
Where different cigarette varieties have the same brand name and a
specific style or variety is not clearly identified as being advertised,

the T/N content of all varieties having that brand name must be disclosed
in the advertisement.

For the sake of summary and emphasis, the new FTC T/N results must
be used after February 21, 1980 in all advertisements in the U.S., its
territories, or that directed to its Armed Forces overseas where the
product advertised is identical in all respects to that reported in the
January 1980 FTC test.

We shall keep you advised if there are any product changes which would
result in new T/N values for that product.

This memorandum does not, and is not intended to, answer all your
questions relating to the impact of the new FTC test results. There-
fore, please contact me if I can be of any further assistance to you in
this matter.

Very truly yours,

L. Hendershot
International Counsel
