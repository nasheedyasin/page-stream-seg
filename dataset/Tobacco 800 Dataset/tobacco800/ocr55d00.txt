“Mr. R. H. Cundiff.

RE: Evaluation of 2X Flue~-Cured Tobacco
for RYO Institutional Blend

" The 2X flue-cured tobaccos were received from Mr. J. H. Winder
in separate grades listed as 1) 2X green pickings, 2) 2X dark .
pickings, 3) 2X yellow LVS and 4) 2X yellow LV. They were
individually incorporated in Top Blends replacing the combined
percentages of 3X tobacco and 20X scrap. Each blend was
evaluated against Regular Top by Product Development Expert
and the International panels. It is our understanding the
2X will not be separated but that all grades will be combined,
therefore, the folluwiug cesulis uve been combined from all tests

conducted:

Top ‘Vs... Top 2X tobacco incorporated
