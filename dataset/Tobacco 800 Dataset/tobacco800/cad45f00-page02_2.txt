FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTMENTS

There is currently a $91,000 deficit situation due to Yen
rate reduction in the months of September and October.
Based on conversations with Forecasting and Planning,
November and December should reflect additional
unfavorability of approximately $300,000. It is suggested
that the unallocated fund balance currently existi in the
Sales Promotion budget be reduced to fund this deficit
situation.
