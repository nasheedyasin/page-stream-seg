Dear Lorraine,

- Here is my account t for the February meeting in Rancho Mirage. We spent a
few weeks in the desert area, luckily escaping one of the worst winters
on record. Now it’s back to reviewing the many applications allocated to
me for the April meeting. | look forward to seeing you then.

Sincerely
