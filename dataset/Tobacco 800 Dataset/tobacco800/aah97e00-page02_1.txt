Dear Art,

Please find enclosed a proposed program for your visit in
Europe. As you will see, this program contains two major

points:

3) A two-days meeting in Neuchatel with all people in
Europe involved in infestation control (proposed
program included).

Visit of all PM Europe production centers with the
purpose of:

- training people in charge of the insect indenti-
fication

= inspection of the sanitary conditions

One of our main problems is the insect identification and
it would be very helpful if you provided us with detailed
pictures or drawings of the most common insects.

I leave it up to you! to organize your travel from the
States to Europe and backwards. We may organize your
travel in Europe.
