» Clearly summarize BACKGROUND, WORKING HYPOTHESIS and BROAD GOALS of the project. Do not

The cellular-yes and cellular-sre genes are homologues of their
oncogenic forms found in the genomes of avian sarcoma viruses,
They encode proteins of approximately 60 kilodalton molecular mass
which are myristylated, associated with membranes, and active as
protein-tyrosine kinases. Physiological functions of these proteins
are not known.

It has been proposed that th s of
non-receptor type tyrosine kinase : because
mutations in that region can inf! ae le ity of
these proteins. It is also assur .\ 1al domains
of tyrosine kinases interact wit’ ins and that
this association modulates their

To test these hypotheses ar ~ mal functions
of the yes and sre proto-oncogenes, we WllL imu v-. udies on
the isolation of proteins that interact with or are phosphorylated by
these kinases using anti-idiotypic antibodies, cDNA expression libraries,
and standard biochemical methods.
