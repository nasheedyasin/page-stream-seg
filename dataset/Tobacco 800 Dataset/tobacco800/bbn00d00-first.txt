Dear Arthur,

Enclosed please find information concerning my move from
Rockefeller to Mount Sinai. I have: informed our financial
officer and the director of our sponsored programs about
the transfer of my lab and my funds.

I had a chance to meet Peter Vogt last month in Maryland

on the occasion of the 11 Annval Meeting on Oncogenes.

He asked me to convey to you his best regards. Some of the
results we obtained for the ligand.of the WW domain have
direct implications for basic virology (role of GAG proteins
in avian retroviruses); Dr. Vogt liked this part of our work
much,

With thanks for your advice and with hope that you will visit
my new lab and my new Department in.the near future.

Yours: sincerely,
